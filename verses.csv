It is twenty years since I first determined to attempt the translationof _Faust_ in the original metres. At that time although more than ascore of English translations of the First Part and three or four ofthe Second Part were in existence the experiment had not yet beenmade. The prose version of Hayward seemed to have been accepted as thestandard in default of anything more satisfactory: the English criticsgenerally sustaining the translator in his views concerning thesecondary importance of form in Poetry practically discouraged anyfurther attempt; and no one familiar with rhythmical expression throughthe needs of his own nature had devoted the necessary love and patienceto an adequate reproduction of the great work of Goethe's life.,faust
[B] "You are right" said Goethe; "there are great and mysteriousagencies included in the various forms of Poetry. If the substance of my'Roman Elegies' were to be expressed in the tone and measure of Byron's'Don Juan' it would really have an atrocious effect."--_Eckermann_.,faust
"The rhythm" said Goethe "is an unconscious result of the poetic mood.If one should stop to consider it mechanically when about to write apoem one would become bewildered and accomplish nothing of realpoetical value."--_Ibid_.,faust
"_All that is poetic in character should be rythmically treated_! Suchis my conviction; and if even a sort of poetic prose should be graduallyintroduced it would only show that the distinction between prose andpoetry had been completely lost sight of."--_Goethe to Schiller_ 1797.,faust
Tycho Mommsen in his excellent essay _Die Kunst des DeutschenUebersetzers aus neueren Sprachen_ goes so far as to say: "The metricalor rhymed modelling of a poetical work is so essentially the germ of itsbeing that rather than by giving it up we might hope to construct asimilar work of art before the eyes of our countrymen by giving up orchanging the substance. The immeasurable result which has followed workswherein the form has been retained--such as the Homer of Voss and theShakespeare of Tieck and Schlegel--is an incontrovertible evidence ofthe vitality of the endeavor.",faust
[C] "Goethe's poems exercise a great sway over me not only by theirmeaning but also by their rhythm. It is a language which stimulates meto composition."--_Beethoven_.,faust
[E] Mr. Lewes gives the following advice: "The English reader wouldperhaps best succeed who should first read Dr. Anster's brilliantparaphrase and then carefully go through Hayward's prose translation."This is singularly at variance with the view he has just expressed. Dr.Anster's version is an almost incredible dilution of the originalwritten in _other_ metres; while Hayward's entirely omits the element ofpoetry.,faust
"Kommt wie der Wind kommt Wenn Wälder erzittern Kommt wie dieBrandung Wenn Flotten zersplittern! Schnell heran schnell herabSchneller kommt Al'e!--Häuptling und Bub' und Knapp Herr und Vasalle!",faust
"Es fällt der Strahl auf Burg und Thal Und schneeige Gipfel reich anSagen; Viel' Lichter wehn auf blauen Seen Bergab die Wasserstürzejagen! Blas Hüfthorn blas in Wiederhall erschallend: BlasHorn--antwortet Echos hallend hallend hallend!",faust
I have a more serious objection however to urge against Mr. Hayward'sprose translation. Where all the restraints of verse are flung aside weshould expect at least as accurate a reproduction of the sensespirit and tone of the original as the genius of our language willpermit. So far from having given us such a reproduction Mr. Hayward notonly occasionally mistakes the exact meaning of the German text[H] butwherever two phrases may be used to express the meaning with equalfidelity he very frequently selects that which has the less gracestrength or beauty.[I],faust
[H] On his second page the line _Mein Lied ertönt der unbekanntenMenge_ "My song sounds to the unknown multitude" is translated: "My_sorrow_ voices itself to the strange throng." Other Englishtranslators I notice have followed Mr. Hayward in mistaking _Lied_ for_Leid_.,faust
I: I take but one out of numerous instances for the sake ofillustration. The close of the Soldier's Song (Part I. Scene II.) is:--,faust
          "Kühn is das Mühen          Herrlich der Lohn!          Und die Soldaten          Ziehen davon.",faust
          Bold is the endeavor          Splendid the pay!          And the soldiers          March away.,faust
          Bold the adventure          Noble the reward--          And the soldiers          Are off.,faust
While therefore I heartily recognize his lofty appreciation of_Faust_--while I honor him for the patient and conscientious labor hehas bestowed upon his translation--I cannot but feel that he hashimself illustrated the unsoundness of his argument. Nevertheless thecircumstance that his prose translation of _Faust_ has received so muchacceptance proves those qualities of the original work which cannot bedestroyed by a test so violent. From the cold bare outline thusproduced the reader unacquainted with the German language wouldscarcely guess what glow of color what richness of changeful life whatfluent grace and energy of movement have been lost in the process. Wemust of course gratefully receive such an outline where a nearerapproach to the form of the original is impossible but until thelatter has been demonstrated we are wrong to remain content with thecheaper substitute.,faust
It seems to me that in all discussions upon this subject the capacitiesof the English language have received but scanty justice. Theintellectual tendencies of our race have always been somewhatconservative and its standards of literary taste or belief once setup are not varied without a struggle. The English ear is suspicious ofnew metres and unaccustomed forms of expression: there are criticaldetectives on the track of every author and a violation of the acceptedcanons is followed by a summons to judgment. Thus the tendency is tocontract rather than to expand the acknowledged excellences of thelanguage.[J],faust
[K] "At present everything runs in technical grooves and the criticalgentlemen begin to wrangle whether in a rhyme an _s_ should correspondwith an _s_ and not with _sz_. If I were young and reckless enough Iwould purposely offend all such technical caprices: I would usealliteration assonance false rhyme just according to my own will orconvenience--but at the same time I would attend to the main thingand endeavor to say so many good things that every one would beattracted to read and remember them."--_Goethe_ in 1831.,faust
_Erhabener Geist im Geisterreich verloren!Wo immer Deine lichte Wohnung seyZum höh'ren Schaffen bist Du neugeborenUnd singest dort die voll're Litanei.Von jenem Streben das Du auserkorenVom reinsten Aether drin Du athmest freiO neige Dich zu gnädigem ErwiedernDes letzten Wiederhalls von Deinen Liedern!,faust
Den alten Musen die bestäubten KronenNahmst Du zu neuem Glanz mit kühner Hand:Du löst die Räthsel ältester AeonenDurch jüngeren Glauben helleren VerstandUnd machst wo rege Menschengeister wohnenDie ganze Erde Dir zum Vaterland;Und Deine Jünger sehn in Dir verwundertVerkörpert schon das werdende Jahrhundert.,faust
Was Du gesungen Aller Lust und KlagenDes Lebens Wiedersprüche neu vermählt--Die Harfe tausendstimmig frisch geschlagenDie Shakspeare einst die einst Homer gewählt--Darf ich in fremde Klänge übertragenDas Alles wo so Mancher schon gefehlt?Lass Deinen Geist in meiner Stimme klingenUnd was Du sangst lass mich es Dir nachsingen!_,faust
Again ye come ye hovering Forms! I find yeAs early to my clouded sight ye shone!Shall I attempt this once to seize and bind ye?Still o'er my heart is that illusion thrown?Ye crowd more near! Then be the reign assigned yeAnd sway me from your misty shadowy zone!My bosom thrills with youthful passion shakenFrom magic airs that round your march awaken.,faust
Of joyous days ye bring the blissful vision;The dear familiar phantoms rise againAnd like an old and half-extinct traditionFirst Love returns with Friendship in his train.Renewed is Pain: with mournful repetitionLife tracks his devious labyrinthine chainAnd names the Good whose cheating fortune tore themFrom happy hours and left me to deplore them.,faust
Dispersed the friendly troop with all its pleasuresAnd still alas! the echoes first that rang!I bring the unknown multitude my treasures;Their very plaudits give my heart a pangAnd those beside whose joy my Song so flatteredIf still they live wide through the world are scattered.,faust
And grasps me now a long-unwonted yearningFor that serene and solemn Spirit-Land:My song to faint Aeolian murmurs turningSways like a harp-string by the breezes fanned.I thrill and tremble; tear on tear is burningAnd the stern heart is tenderly unmanned.What I possess I see far distant lyingAnd what I lost grows real and undying.,faust
Speak not to me of yonder motley massesWhom but to see puts out the fire of Song!Hide from my view the surging crowd that passesAnd in its whirlpool forces us along!No lead me where some heavenly silence glassesThe purer joys that round the Poet throng--Where Love and Friendship still divinely fashionThe bonds that bless the wreaths that crown his passion!Ah every utterance from the depths of feelingThe timid lips have stammeringly expressed--Now failing now perchance success revealing--Gulps the wild Moment in its greedy breast;Or oft reluctant years its warrant sealingIts perfect stature stands at last confessed!What dazzles for the Moment spends its spirit:What's genuine shall Posterity inherit.,faust
Posterity! Don't name the word to me!If _I_ should choose to preach PosterityWhere would you get contemporary fun?That men _will_ have it there's no blinking:A fine young fellow's presence to my thinkingIs something worth to every one.Who genially his nature can outpourTakes from the People's moods no irritation;The wider circle he acquires the moreSecurely works his inspiration.Then pluck up heart and give us sterling coin!Let Fancy be with her attendants fitted--Sense Reason Sentiment and Passion join--But have a care lest Folly be omitted!,faust
Chiefly enough of incident prepare!They come to look and they prefer to stare.Reel off a host of threads before their facesSo that they gape in stupid wonder: thenBy sheer diffuseness you have won their gracesAnd are at once most popular of men.Only by mass you touch the mass; for anyWill finally himself his bit select:Who offers much brings something unto manyAnd each goes home content with the effectIf you've a piece why just in pieces give it:A hash a stew will bring success believe it!'Tis easily displayed and easy to invent.What use a Whole compactly to present?Your hearers pick and pluck as soon as they receive it!,faust
You do not feel how such a trade debases;How ill it suits the Artist proud and true!The botching work each fine pretender tracesIs I perceive a principle with you.,faust
Then give me back that time of pleasuresWhile yet in joyous growth I sang--When like a fount the crowding measuresUninterrupted gushed and sprang!Then bright mist veiled the world before meIn opening buds a marvel wokeAs I the thousand blossoms brokeWhich every valley richly bore me!I nothing had and yet enough for youth--Joy in Illusion ardent thirst for Truth.Give unrestrained the old emotionThe bliss that touched the verge of painThe strength of Hate Love's deep devotion--O give me back my youth again!,faust
Youth good my friend you certainly requireWhen foes in combat sorely press you;When lovely maids in fond desireHang on your bosom and caress you;When from the hard-won goal the wreathBeckons afar the race awaiting;When after dancing out your breathYou pass the night in dissipating:--But that familiar harp with soulTo play--with grace and bold expressionAnd towards a self-erected goalTo walk with many a sweet digression--This aged Sirs belongs to youAnd we no less revere you for that reason:Age childish makes they say but 'tis not true;We're only genuine children still in Age's season!,faust
The sun-orb sings in emulation'Mid brother-spheres his ancient round:His path predestined through CreationHe ends with step of thunder-sound.The angels from his visage splendidDraw power whose measure none can say;The lofty works uncomprehendedAre bright as on the earliest day.,faust
And swift and swift beyond conceivingThe splendor of the world goes roundDay's Eden-brightness still relievingThe awful Night's intense profound:The ocean-tides in foam are breakingAgainst the rocks' deep bases hurledAnd both the spheric race partakingEternal swift are onward whirled!,faust
And rival storms abroad are surgingFrom sea to land from land to sea.A chain of deepest action forgingRound all in wrathful energy.There flames a desolation blazingBefore the Thunder's crashing way:Yet Lord Thy messengers are praisingThe gentle movement of Thy Day.,faust
Though still by them uncomprehendedFrom these the angels draw their powerAnd all Thy works sublime and splendidAre bright as in Creation's hour.,faust
Since Thou O Lord deign'st to approach againAnd ask us how we do in manner kindestAnd heretofore to meet myself wert fainAmong Thy menials now my face Thou findest.Pardon this troop I cannot follow afterWith lofty speech though by them scorned and spurned:My pathos certainly would move Thy laughterIf Thou hadst not all merriment unlearned.Of suns and worlds I've nothing to be quoted;How men torment themselves is all I've noted.The little god o' the world sticks to the same old wayAnd is as whimsical as on Creation's day.Life somewhat better might content himBut for the gleam of heavenly light which Thou hast lent  him:He calls it Reason--thence his power's increasedTo be far beastlier than any beast.Saving Thy Gracious Presence he to meA long-legged grasshopper appears to beThat springing flies and flying springsAnd in the grass the same old ditty sings.Would he still lay among the grass he grows in!Each bit of dung he seeks to stick his nose in.,faust
Hast thou then nothing more to mention?Com'st ever thus with ill intention?Find'st nothing right on earth eternally?,faust
No Lord! I find things there still bad as they can be.Man's misery even to pity moves my nature;I've scarce the heart to plague the wretched creature.,faust
Forsooth! He serves you after strange devices:No earthly meat or drink the fool suffices:His spirit's ferment far aspireth;Half conscious of his frenzied crazed unrestThe fairest stars from Heaven he requirethFrom Earth the highest raptures and the bestAnd all the Near and Far that he desirethFails to subdue the tumult of his breast.,faust
Though still confused his service unto MeI soon shall lead him to a clearer morning.Sees not the gardener even while buds his treeBoth flower and fruit the future years adorning?,faust
What will you bet? There's still a chance to gain himIf unto me full leave you giveGently upon _my_ road to train him!,faust
As long as he on earth shall liveSo long I make no prohibition.While Man's desires and aspirations stirHe cannot choose but err.,faust
My thanks! I find the dead no acquisitionAnd never cared to have them in my keeping.I much prefer the cheeks where ruddy blood is leapingAnd when a corpse approaches close my house:It goes with me as with the cat the mouse.,faust
Enough! What thou hast asked is granted.Turn off this spirit from his fountain-head;To trap him let thy snares be plantedAnd him with thee be downward led;Then stand abashed when thou art forced to say:A good man through obscurest aspirationHas still an instinct of the one true way.,faust
Agreed! But 'tis a short probation.About my bet I feel no trepidation.If I fulfill my expectationYou'll let me triumph with a swelling breast:Dust shall he eat and with a zestAs did a certain snake my near relation.,faust
Therein thou'rt free according to thy merits;The like of thee have never moved My hate.Of all the bold denying SpiritsThe waggish knave least trouble doth create.Man's active nature flagging seeks too soon the level;Unqualified repose he learns to crave;Whence willingly the comrade him I gaveWho works excites and must create as Devil.But ye God's sons in love and dutyEnjoy the rich the ever-living Beauty!Creative Power that works eternal schemesClasp you in bonds of love relaxing neverAnd what in wavering apparition gleamsFix in its place with thoughts that stand forever!,faust
I like at times to hear The Ancient's wordAnd have a care to be most civil:It's really kind of such a noble LordSo humanly to gossip with the Devil![Illustration][Illustration],faust
I've studied now PhilosophyAnd Jurisprudence Medicine--And even alas! Theology--From end to end with labor keen;And here poor fool! with all my loreI stand no wiser than before:I'm Magister--yea Doctor--hightAnd straight or cross-wise wrong or rightThese ten years long with many woesI've led my scholars by the nose--And see that nothing can be known!_That_ knowledge cuts me to the bone.I'm cleverer true than those fops of teachersDoctors and Magisters Scribes and Preachers;Neither scruples nor doubts come now to smite meNor Hell nor Devil can longer affright me.,faust
For this all pleasure am I foregoing;I do not pretend to aught worth knowingI do not pretend I could be a teacherTo help or convert a fellow-creature.Then too I've neither lands nor goldNor the world's least pomp or honor hold--No dog would endure such a curst existence!Wherefore from Magic I seek assistanceThat many a secret perchance I reachThrough spirit-power and spirit-speechAnd thus the bitter task foregoOf saying the things I do not know--That I may detect the inmost forceWhich binds the world and guides its course;Its germs productive powers exploreAnd rummage in empty words no more!,faust
O full and splendid Moon whom IHave from this desk seen climb the skySo many a midnight--would thy glowFor the last time beheld my woe!Ever thine eye most mournful friendO'er books and papers saw me bend;But would that I on mountains grandAmid thy blessed light could standWith spirits through mountain-caverns hoverFloat in thy twilight the meadows overAnd freed from the fumes of lore that swathe meTo health in thy dewy fountains bathe me!,faust
Ah me! this dungeon still I see.This drear accursed masonryWhere even the welcome daylight strainsBut duskly through the painted panes.Hemmed in by many a toppling heapOf books worm-eaten gray with dustWhich to the vaulted ceiling creepAgainst the smoky paper thrust--With glasses boxes round me stackedAnd instruments together hurledAncestral lumber stuffed and packed--Such is my world: and what a world!,faust
And do I ask wherefore my heartFalters oppressed with unknown needs?Why some inexplicable smartAll movement of my life impedes?Alas! in living Nature's steadWhere God His human creature setIn smoke and mould the fleshless deadAnd bones of beasts surround me yet!,faust
Fly! Up and seek the broad free land!And this one Book of MysteryFrom Nostradamus' very handIs't not sufficient company?When I the starry courses knowAnd Nature's wise instruction seekWith light of power my soul shall glowAs when to spirits spirits speak.Tis vain this empty brooding hereThough guessed the holy symbols be:Ye Spirits come--ye hover near--Oh if you hear me answer me!,faust
Ha! what a sudden rapture leaps from thisI view through all my senses swiftly flowing!I feel a youthful holy vital blissIn every vein and fibre newly glowing.Was it a God who traced this signWith calm across my tumult stealingMy troubled heart to joy unsealingWith impulse mystic and divineThe powers of Nature here around my path revealing?Am I a God?--so clear mine eyes!In these pure features I beholdCreative Nature to my soul unfold.What says the sage now first I recognize:"The spirit-world no closures fasten;Thy sense is shut thy heart is dead:Disciple up! untiring hastenTo bathe thy breast in morning-red!",faust
How each the Whole its substance givesEach in the other works and lives!Like heavenly forces rising and descendingTheir golden urns reciprocally lendingWith wings that winnow blessingFrom Heaven through Earth I see them pressingFilling the All with harmony unceasing!How grand a show! but ah! a show alone.Thee boundless Nature how make thee my own?Where you ye beasts? Founts of all Being shiningWhereon hang Heaven's and Earth's desireWhereto our withered hearts aspire--Ye flow ye feed: and am I vainly pining?,faust
How otherwise upon me works this sign!Thou Spirit of the Earth art nearer:Even now my powers are loftier clearer;I glow as drunk with new-made wine:New strength and heart to meet the world incite meThe woe of earth the bliss of earth invite meAnd though the shock of storms may smite meNo crash of shipwreck shall have power to fright me!Clouds gather over me--The moon conceals her light--The lamp's extinguished!--Mists rise--red angry rays are dartingAround my head!--There fallsA horror from the vaulted roofAnd seizes me!I feel thy presence Spirit I invoke!Reveal thyself!Ha! in my heart what rending stroke!With new impulsionMy senses heave in this convulsion!I feel thee draw my heart absorb exhaust me:Thou must! thou must! and though my life it cost me!,faust
(_He seizes the book and mysteriously pronounces the sign ofthe Spirit. A ruddy flame flashes: the Spirit appears inthe flame_.),faust
To view me is thine aspirationMy voice to hear my countenance to see;Thy powerful yearning moveth meHere am I!--what mean perturbationThee superhuman shakes? Thy soul's high calling where?Where is the breast which from itself a world did bearAnd shaped and cherished--which with joy expandedTo be our peer with us the Spirits banded?Where art thou Faust whose voice has pierced to meWho towards me pressed with all thine energy?_He_ art thou who my presence breathing seeingTrembles through all the depths of beingA writhing worm a terror-stricken form?,faust
  In the tides of Life in Action's storm  A fluctuant wave  A shuttle free  Birth and the Grave  An eternal sea  A weaving flowing  Life all-glowingThus at Time's humming loom 'tis my hand preparesThe garment of Life which the Deity wears!,faust
O Death!--I know it--'tis my Famulus!My fairest luck finds no fruition:In all the fullness of my visionThe soulless sneak disturbs me thus!,faust
Pardon I heard your declamation;'Twas sure an old Greek tragedy you read?In such an art I crave some preparationSince now it stands one in good stead.I've often heard it said a preacherMight learn with a comedian for a teacher.,faust
Ah when one studies thus a prisoned creatureThat scarce the world on holidays can see--Scarce through a glass by rare occasionHow shall one lead it by persuasion?,faust
You'll ne'er attain it save you know the feelingSave from the soul it rises clearSerene in primal strength compellingThe hearts and minds of all who hear.You sit forever gluing patching;You cook the scraps from others' fare;And from your heap of ashes hatchingA starveling flame ye blow it bare!Take children's monkeys' gaze admiringIf such your taste and be content;But ne'er from heart to heart you'll speak inspiringSave your own heart is eloquent!,faust
Seek thou the honest recompense!Beware a tinkling fool to be!With little art clear wit and senseSuggest their own delivery;And if thou'rt moved to speak in earnestWhat need that after words thou yearnest?Yes your discourses with their glittering showWhere ye for men twist shredded thought like paperAre unrefreshing as the winds that blowThe rustling leaves through chill autumnal vapor!,faust
Ah God! but Art is longAnd Life alas! is fleeting.And oft with zeal my critic-duties meetingIn head and breast there's something wrong.,faust
How hard it is to compass the assistanceWhereby one rises to the source!And haply ere one travels half the courseMust the poor devil quit existence.,faust
Is parchment then the holy fount before theeA draught wherefrom thy thirst forever slakes?No true refreshment can restore theeSave what from thine own soul spontaneous breaks.,faust
Pardon! a great delight is grantedWhen in the spirit of the ages plantedWe mark how ere our times a sage has thoughtAnd then how far his work and grandly we have brought.,faust
O yes up to the stars at last!Listen my friend: the ages that are pastAre now a book with seven seals protected:What you the Spirit of the Ages callIs nothing but the spirit of you allWherein the Ages are reflected.So oftentimes you miserably mar it!At the first glance who sees it runs away.An offal-barrel and a lumber-garretOr at the best a Punch-and-Judy playWith maxims most pragmatical and hittingAs in the mouths of puppets are befitting!,faust
Yes of the kind which men attain!Who dares the child's true name in public mention?The few who thereof something really learnedUnwisely frank with hearts that spurned concealingAnd to the mob laid bare each thought and feelingHave evermore been crucified and burned.I pray you Friend 'tis now the dead of night;Our converse here must be suspended.,faust
I would have shared your watches with delightThat so our learned talk might be extended.To-morrow though I'll ask in Easter leisureThis and the other question at your pleasure.Most zealously I seek for erudition:Much do I know--but to know all is my ambition.,faust
That brain alone not loses hope whose choice isTo stick in shallow trash forevermore--Which digs with eager hand for buried oreAnd when it finds an angle-worm rejoices!,faust
Dare such a human voice disturb the flowAround me here of spirit-presence fullest?And yet this once my thanks I oweTo thee of all earth's sons the poorest dullest!For thou hast torn me from that desperate stateWhich threatened soon to overwhelm my senses:The apparition was so giant-greatIt dwarfed and withered all my soul's pretences!,faust
I image of the Godhead who began--Deeming Eternal Truth secure in nearness--Ye choirs have ye begun the sweet consoling chantWhich through the night of Death the angels ministrantSang God's new Covenant repeating?,faust
          With spices and precious          Balm we arrayed him;          Faithful and gracious          We tenderly laid him:          Linen to bind him          Cleanlily wound we:          Ah! when we would find him          Christ no more found we!,faust
          Christ is ascended!          Bliss hath invested him--          Woes that molested him          Trials that tested him          Gloriously ended!,faust
Why here in dust entice me with your spellYe gentle powerful sounds of Heaven?Peal rather there where tender natures dwell.Your messages I hear but faith has not been given;The dearest child of Faith is Miracle.I venture not to soar to yonder regionsWhence the glad tidings hither float;And yet from childhood up familiar with the noteTo Life it now renews the old allegiance.Once Heavenly Love sent down a burning kissUpon my brow in Sabbath silence holy;And filled with mystic presage chimed the church-bell slowlyAnd prayer dissolved me in a fervent bliss.A sweet uncomprehended yearningDrove forth my feet through woods and meadows freeAnd while a thousand tears were burningI felt a world arise for me.These chants to youth and all its sports appealingProclaimed the Spring's rejoicing holiday;And Memory holds me now with childish feelingBack from the last the solemn way.Sound on ye hymns of Heaven so sweet and mild!My tears gush forth: the Earth takes back her child!,faust
        Has He victoriously        Burst from the vaulted        Grave and all-gloriously        Now sits exalted?        Is He in glow of birth        Rapture creative near?        Ah! to the woe of earth        Still are we native here.        We his aspiring        Followers Him we miss;        Weeping desiring        Master Thy bliss!,faust
        Christ is arisen        Out of Corruption's womb:        Burst ye the prison        Break from your gloom!        Praising and pleading him        Lovingly needing him        Brotherly feeding him        Preaching and speeding him        Blessing succeeding Him        Thus is the Master near--        Thus is He here![Illustration],faust

Deuce! how they step the buxom wenches!Come Brother! we must see them to the benches.A strong old beer a pipe that stings and bitesA girl in Sunday clothes--these three are my delights.,faust
Just see those handsome fellows there!It's really shameful I declare;--To follow servant-girls when theyMight have the most genteel society to-day!,faust
Not quite so fast! Two others come behind--Those dressed so prettily and neatly.My neighbor's one of them I findA girl that takes my heart completely.They go their way with looks demureBut they'll accept us after all I'm sure.,faust
No Brother! not for me their formal ways.Quick! lest our game escape us in the press:The hand that wields the broom on SaturdaysWill best on Sundays fondle and caress.,faust
He suits me not at all our new-made Burgomaster!Since he's installed his arrogance grows faster.How has he helped the town I say?Things worsen--what improvement names he?Obedience more than ever claims heAnd more than ever we must pay!,faust
  Good gentlemen and lovely ladies  So red of cheek and fine of dress  Behold how needful here your aid is  And see and lighten my distress!  Let me not vainly sing my ditty;  He's only glad who gives away:  A holiday that shows your pity  Shall be for me a harvest-day!,faust
On Sundays holidays there's naught I take delight inLike gossiping of war and war's arrayWhen down in Turkey far awayThe foreign people are a-fighting.One at the window sits with glass and friendsAnd sees all sorts of ships go down the river gliding:And blesses then as home he wendsAt night our times of peace abiding.,faust
Yes Neighbor! that's my notion too:Why let them break their heads let loose their passionsAnd mix things madly through and throughSo here we keep our good old fashions!,faust
Dear me how fine! So handsome and so young!Who wouldn't lose his heart that met you?Don't be so proud! I'll hold my tongueAnd what you'd like I'll undertake to get you.,faust
Come Agatha! I shun the witch's sightBefore folks lest there be misgiving:'Tis true she showed me on Saint Andrew's NightMy future sweetheart just as he were living.,faust

Lads let the trumpets        For us be suing--        Calling to pleasure        Calling to ruin.        Stormy our life is;        Such is its boon!        Maidens and castles        Capitulate soon.        Bold is the venture        Splendid the pay!        And the soldiers go marching        Marching away!,faust
To stroll with you Sir Doctor flatters;'Tis honor profit unto me.But I alone would shun these shallow mattersSince all that's coarse provokes my enmity.This fiddling shouting ten-pin rollingI hate--these noises of the throng:They rave as Satan were their sports controlling.And call it mirth and call it song!,faust
          All for the dance the shepherd dressed          In ribbons wreath and gayest vest            Himself with care arraying:          Around the linden lass and lad          Already footed it like mad:            Hurrah! hurrah!            Hurrah--tarara-la!          The fiddle-bow was playing.,faust
          He broke the ranks no whit afraid          And with his elbow punched a maid            Who stood the dance surveying:          The buxom wench she turned and said:          "Now you I call a stupid-head!"            Hurrah! hurrah!            Hurrah--tarara-la!          "Be decent while you're staying!",faust
          Then round the circle went their flight          They danced to left they danced to right:          Their kirtles all were playing.          They first grew red and then grew warm          And rested panting arm in arm--            Hurrah! hurrah!            Hurrah--tarara-la!          And hips and elbows straying.,faust
          Now don't be so familiar here!          How many a one has fooled his dear          Waylaying and betraying!,faust
          And yet he coaxed her soon aside          And round the linden sounded wide.            Hurrah! hurrah!            Hurrah--tarara-la!          And the fiddle-bow was playing.,faust
Sir Doctor it is good of youThat thus you condescend to-dayAmong this crowd of merry folkA highly-learned man to stray.Then also take the finest canWe fill with fresh wine for your sake:I offer it and humbly wishThat not alone your thirst is slake--That as the drops below its brinkSo many days of life you drink!,faust
In truth 'tis well and fitly timedThat now our day of joy you shareWho heretofore in evil daysGave us so much of helping care.Still many a man stands living hereSaved by your father's skillful handThat snatched him from the fever's rageAnd stayed the plague in all the land.Then also you though but a youthWent into every house of pain:Many the corpses carried forthBut you in health came out again.,faust
With what a feeling thou great man must thouReceive the people's honest veneration!How lucky he whose gifts his stationWith such advantages endow!Thou'rt shown to all the younger generation:Each asks and presses near to gaze;The fiddle stops the dance delays.Thou goest they stand in rows to seeAnd all the caps are lifted high;A little more and they would bend the kneeAs if the Holy Host came by.,faust
Why therefore yield to such depression?A good man does his honest shareIn exercising with the strictest careThe art bequeathed to his possession!Dost thou thy father honor as a youth?Then may his teaching cheerfully impel thee:Dost thou as man increase the stores of truth?Then may thine own son afterwards excel thee.,faust
I've had myself at times some odd capricesBut never yet such impulse felt as this is.One soon fatigues on woods and fields to lookNor would I beg the bird his wing to spare us:How otherwise the mental raptures bear usFrom page to page from book to book!Then winter nights take loveliness untoldAs warmer life in every limb had crowned you;And when your hands unroll some parchment rare and oldAll Heaven descends and opens bright around you!,faust
One impulse art thou conscious of at best;O never seek to know the other!Two souls alas! reside within my breastAnd each withdraws from and repels its brother.One with tenacious organs holds in loveAnd clinging lust the world in its embraces;The other strongly sweeps this dust aboveInto the high ancestral spaces.If there be airy spirits near'Twixt Heaven and Earth on potent errands fleeingLet them drop down the golden atmosphereAnd bear me forth to new and varied being!Yea if a magic mantle once were mineTo waft me o'er the world at pleasureI would not for the costliest stores of treasure--Not for a monarch's robe--the gift resign.,faust
Invoke not thus the well-known throngWhich through the firmament diffused is faringAnd danger thousand-fold our race to wrong.In every quarter is preparing.Swift from the North the spirit-fangs so sharpSweep down and with their barbéd points assail you;Then from the East they come to dry and warpYour lungs till breath and being fail you:If from the Desert sendeth them the SouthWith fire on fire your throbbing forehead crowningThe West leads on a host to cure the drouthOnly when meadow field and you are drowning.They gladly hearken prompt for injury--Gladly obey because they gladly cheat us;From Heaven they represent themselves to beAnd lisp like angels when with lies they meet us.But let us go! 'Tis gray and dusky all:The air is cold the vapors fall.At night one learns his house to prize:--Why stand you thus with such astonished eyes?What in the twilight can your mind so trouble?,faust
Seest thou the spiral circles narrowing fasterWhich he approaching round us seems to wind?A streaming trail of fire if I see rightlyFollows his path of mystery.,faust
A dog thou seest and not a phantom here!Behold him stop--upon his belly crawl--Histail set wagging: canine habits all!,faust
'Tis the absurdest drollest beast.Stand still and you will see him wait;Address him and he gambols straight;If something's lost he'll quickly bring it--Your cane if in the stream you fling it.,faust
The dog when he's well educatedIs by the wisest tolerated.Yes he deserves your favor thoroughly--The clever scholar of the students he!,faust
     Behind me field and meadow sleeping     I leave in deep prophetic night     Within whose dread and holy keeping     The better soul awakes to light.     The wild desires no longer win us     The deeds of passion cease to chain;     The love of Man revives within us     The love of God revives again.,faust
Be still thou poodle; make not such racket and riot!Why at the threshold wilt snuffing be?Behind the stove repose thee in quiet!My softest cushion I give to thee.As thou up yonder with running and leapingAmused us hast on the mountain's crest,faust
     Ah when within our narrow chamber     The lamp with friendly lustre glows     Flames in the breast each faded ember     And in the heart itself that knows.     Then Hope again lends sweet assistance     And Reason then resumes her speech:     One yearns the rivers of existence     The very founts of Life to reach.,faust
Snarl not poodle! To the sound that risesThe sacred tones that my soul embraceThis bestial noise is out of place.We are used to see that Man despisesWhat he never comprehendsAnd the Good and the Beautiful vilipendsFinding them often hard to measure:Will the dog like man snarl _his_ displeasure?,faust
But ah! I feel though will thereto be strongerContentment flows from out my breast no longer.Why must the stream so soon run dry and fail usAnd burning thirst again assail us?Therein I've borne so much probation!And yet this want may be supplied us;We call the Supernatural to guide us;We pine and thirst for RevelationWhich nowhere worthier is more nobly sentThan here in our New Testament.I feel impelled its meaning to determine--With honest purpose once for allThe hallowed OriginalTo change to my beloved German.,faust
(_He opens a volume and commences_.)'Tis written: "In the Beginning was the _Word_."Here am I balked: who now can help afford?The _Word?_--impossible so high to rate it;And otherwise must I translate it.If by the Spirit I am truly taught.Then thus: "In the Beginning was the _Thought_"This first line let me weigh completelyLest my impatient pen proceed too fleetly.Is it the _Thought_ which works creates indeed?"In the Beginning was the _Power"_ I read.Yet as I write a warning is suggestedThat I the sense may not have fairly tested.The Spirit aids me: now I see the light!"In the Beginning was the _Act_" I write.,faust
If I must share my chamber with theePoodle stop that howling prithee!Cease to bark and bellow!Such a noisy disturbing fellowI'll no longer suffer near me.One of us dost hear me!Must leave I fear me.No longer guest-right I bestow;The door is open art free to go.But what do I see in the creature?Is that in the course of nature?Is't actual fact? or Fancy's shows?How long and broad my poodle grows!He rises mightily:A canine form that cannot be!What a spectre I've harbored thus!He resembles a hippopotamusWith fiery eyes teeth terrible to see:O now am I sure of thee!For all of thy half-hellish broodThe Key of Solomon is good.,faust
     Some one within is caught!     Stay without follow him not!     Like the fox in a snare     Quakes the old hell-lynx there.     Take heed--look about!     Back and forth hover     Under and over     And he'll work himself out.     If your aid avail him     Let it not fail him;     For he without measure     Has wrought for our pleasure.,faust
First to encounter the beastThe Words of the Four be addressed:    Salamander shine glorious!    Wave Undine as bidden!    Sylph be thou hidden!    Gnome be laborious!,faust
Who knows not their sense(These elements)--Their propertiesAnd power not sees--No mastery he inheritsOver the Spirits.,faust
     Vanish in flaming ether     Salamander!     Flow foamingly together     Undine!     Shine in meteor-sheen     Sylph!     Bring help to hearth and shelf.     Incubus! Incubus!     Step forward and finish thus!,faust
Of the Four no featureLurks in the creature.Quiet he lies and grins disdain:Not yet it seems have I given him pain.Now to undisguise theeHear me exorcise thee!Art thou my gay oneHell's fugitive stray-one?The sign witness nowBefore which they bowThe cohorts of Hell!,faust
     Base Being hearest thou?     Knowest and fearest thou     The One unoriginate     Named inexpressibly     Through all Heaven impermeate     Pierced irredressibly!,faust
Behind the stove still bannedSee it an elephant expand!It fills the space entireMist-like melting ever faster.'Tis enough: ascend no higher--Lay thyself at the feet of the Master!Thou seest not vain the threats I bring thee:With holy fire I'll scorch and sting thee!Wait not to knowThe threefold dazzling glow!Wait not to knowThe strongest art within my hands!,faust
(_while the vapor is dissipating steps forth from behind thestove in the costume of a Travelling Scholar_.)Why such a noise? What are my lord's commands?,faust
A question small it seemsFor one whose mind the Word so much despises;Who scorning all external gleamsThe depths of being only prizes.,faust
With all you gentlemen the name's a testWhereby the nature usually is expressed.Clearly the latter it impliesIn names like Beelzebub Destroyer Father of Lies.Who art thou then?,faust
I am the Spirit that Denies!And justly so: for all things from the VoidCalled forth deserve to be destroyed:'Twere better then were naught created.Thus all which you as Sin have rated--Destruction--aught with Evil blent--That is my proper element.,faust
The modest truth I speak to thee.If Man that microcosmic fool can seeHimself a whole so frequentlyPart of the Part am I once All in primal Night--Part of the Darkness which brought forth the LightThe haughty Light which now disputes the spaceAnd claims of Mother Night her ancient place.And yet the struggle fails; since Light howe'er it weavesStill fettered unto bodies cleaves:It flows from bodies bodies beautifies;By bodies is its course impeded;And so but little time is neededI hope ere as the bodies die it dies!,faust
I see the plan thou art pursuing:Thou canst not compass general ruinAnd hast on smaller scale begun.,faust
And truly 'tis not much when all is done.That which to Naught is in resistance set--The Something of this clumsy world--has yetWith all that I have undertakenNot been by me disturbed or shaken:From earthquake tempest wave volcano's brandBack into quiet settle sea and land!And that damned stuff the bestial human brood--What use in having that to play with?How many have I made away with!And ever circulates a newer fresher blood.It makes me furious such things beholding:From Water Earth and Air unfoldingA thousand germs break forth and growIn dry and wet and warm and chilly;And had I not the Flame reserved why reallyThere's nothing special of my own to show!,faust
So to the actively eternalCreative force in cold disdainYou now oppose the fist infernalWhose wicked clench is all in vain!Some other labor seek thou ratherQueer Son of Chaos to begin!,faust
Well we'll consider: thou canst gatherMy views when next I venture in.Might I perhaps depart at present?,faust
Why thou shouldst ask I don't perceive.Though our acquaintance is so recentFor further visits thou hast leave.The window's here the door is yonder;A chimney also you behold.,faust
I must confess that forth I may not wanderMy steps by one slight obstacle controlled--The wizard's-foot that on your threshold made is.,faust
The pentagram prohibits thee?Why tell me now thou Son of HadesIf that prevents how cam'st thou in to me?Could such a spirit be so cheated?,faust
Inspect the thing: the drawing's not completed.The outer angle you may seeIs open left--the lines don't fit it.,faust
Well--Chance this time has fairly hit it!And thus thou'rt prisoner to me?It seems the business has succeeded.,faust
The poodle naught remarked as after thee he speeded;But other aspects now obtain:The Devil can't get out again.,faust
For Devils and for spectres this is law:Where they have entered in there also they withdraw.The first is free to us; we're governed by the second.,faust
In Hell itself then laws are reckoned?That's well! So might a compact beMade with you gentlemen--and binding--surely?,faust
All that is promised shall delight thee purely;No skinflint bargain shalt thou see.But this is not of swift conclusion;We'll talk about the matter soon.And now I do entreat this boon--Leave to withdraw from my intrusion.,faust
I have not snares around thee cast;Thyself hast led thyself into the meshes.Who traps the Devil hold him fast!Not soon a second time he'll catch a prey so precious.,faust
An't please thee also I'm content to stayAnd serve thee in a social station;But stipulating that I mayWith arts of mine afford thee recreation.,faust
My friend thou'lt win past all pretencesMore in this hour to soothe thy sensesThan in the year's monotony.That which the dainty spirits sing theeThe lovely pictures they shall bring theeAre more than magic's empty show.Thy scent will be to bliss invited;Thy palate then with taste delightedThy nerves of touch ecstatic glow!All unprepared the charm I spin:We're here together so begin!,faust
He sleeps! Enough ye fays! your airy numberHave sung him truly into slumber:For this performance I your debtor prove.--Not yet art thou the man to catch the Fiend and hold him!--With fairest images of dreams infold himPlunge him in seas of sweet untruth!Yet for the threshold's magic which controlled himThe Devil needs a rat's quick tooth.I use no lengthened invocation:Here rustles one that soon will work my liberation.,faust
The lord of rats and eke of miceOf flies and bed-bugs frogs and liceSummons thee hither to the door-sillTo gnaw it where with just a morselOf oil he paints the spot for thee:--There com'st thou hopping on to me!To work at once! The point which made me cravenIs forward on the ledge engraven.Another bite makes free the door:So dream thy dreams O Faust until we meet once more!,faust
Am I again so foully cheated?Remains there naught of lofty spirit-swayBut that a dream the Devil counterfeitedAnd that a poodle ran away?,faust
                   Thus thou pleasest me.I hope we'll suit each other well;For now thy vapors to dispelI come a squire of high degreeIn scarlet coat with golden trimmingA cloak in silken lustre swimmingA tall cock's-feather in my hatA long sharp sword for show or quarrel--And I advise thee brief and flatTo don the self-same gay apparelThat from this den released and freeLife be at last revealed to thee!,faust
O fortunate for whom when victory glancesThe bloody laurels on the brow he bindeth!Whom after rapid maddening dancesIn clasping maiden-arms he findeth!O would that I before that spirit-powerRavished and rapt from life had sunken!,faust
Though some familiar tone retrievingMy thoughts from torment led me onAnd sweet clear echoes came deceivingA faith bequeathed from Childhood's dawnYet now I curse whate'er enticesAnd snares the soul with visions vain;With dazzling cheats and dear devicesConfines it in this cave of pain!Cursed be at once the high ambitionWherewith the mind itself deludes!Cursed be the glare of apparitionThat on the finer sense intrudes!Cursed be the lying dream's impressionOf name and fame and laurelled brow!Cursed all that flatters as possessionAs wife and child as knave and plow!Cursed Mammon be when he with treasuresTo restless action spurs our fate!Cursed when for soft indulgent leisuresHe lays for us the pillows straight!Cursed be the vine's transcendent nectar--The highest favor Love lets fall!Cursed also Hope!--cursed Faith the spectre!And cursed be Patience most of all!,faust
     Woe! woe!     Thou hast it destroyed     The beautiful world     With powerful fist:     In ruin 'tis hurled     By the blow of a demigod shattered!     The scattered     Fragments into the Void we carry     Deploring     The beauty perished beyond restoring.     Mightier     For the children of men     Brightlier     Build it again     In thine own bosom build it anew!     Bid the new career     Commence     With clearer sense     And the new songs of cheer     Be sung thereto!,faust
These are the small dependantsWho give me attendance.Hear them to deeds and passionCounsel in shrewd old-fashion!Into the world of strifeOut of this lonely lifeThat of senses and sap has betrayed theeThey would persuade thee.This nursing of the pain forego theeThat like a vulture feeds upon thy breast!The worst society thou find'st will show theeThou art a man among the rest.But 'tis not meant to thrustThee into the mob thou hatest!I am not one of the greatestYet wilt thou to me entrustThy steps through life I'll guide thee--Will willingly walk beside thee--Will serve thee at once and foreverWith best endeavorAnd if thou art satisfiedWill as servant slave with thee abide.,faust
No--no! The Devil is an egotistAnd is not apt without a why or wherefore"For God's sake" others to assist.Speak thy conditions plain and clear!With such a servant danger comes I fear.,faust
_Here_ an unwearied slave I'll wear thy tetherAnd to thine every nod obedient be:When _There_ again we come togetherThen shalt thou do the same for me.,faust
The _There_ my scruples naught increases.When thou hast dashed this world to piecesThe other then its place may fill.Here on this earth my pleasures have their sources;Yon sun beholds my sorrows in his courses;And when from these my life itself divorcesLet happen all that can or will!I'll hear no more: 'tis vain to ponderIf there we cherish love or hateOr in the spheres we dream of yonderA High and Low our souls await.,faust
In this sense even canst thou venture.Come bind thyself by prompt indentureAnd thou mine arts with joy shalt see:What no man ever saw I'll give to thee.,faust
Canst thou poor Devil give me whatsoever?When was a human soul in its supreme endeavorE'er understood by such as thou?Yet hast thou food which never satiates now--The restless ruddy gold hast thouThat runs quicksilver-like one's fingers through--A game whose winnings no man ever knew--A maid that even from my breastBeckons my neighbor with her wanton glancesAnd Honor's godlike zestThe meteor that a moment dances--Show me the fruits that ere they're gathered rotAnd trees that daily with new leafage clothe them!,faust
Such a demand alarms me not:Such treasures have I and can show them.But still the time may reach us good my friend.When peace we crave and more luxurious diet.,faust
When on an idler's bed I stretch myself in quiet.There let at once my record end!Canst thou with lying flattery rule meUntil self-pleased myself I see--Canst thou with rich enjoyment fool meLet that day be the last for me!The bet I offer.,faust
FAUST                         And heartily!When thus I hail the Moment flying:"Ah still delay--thou art so fair!"Then bind me in thy bonds undyingMy final ruin then declare!Then let the death-bell chime the token.Then art thou from thy service free!The clock may stop the hand be brokenThen Time be finished unto me!,faust
Thou hast a perfect right thereto.My powers I have not rashly estimated:A slave am I whate'er I do--If thine or whose? 'tis needless to debate it.,faust
Then at the Doctors'-banquet I to-dayWill as a servant wait behind thee.But one thing more! Beyond all risk to bind theeGive me a line or two I pray.,faust
Demand'st thou Pedant too a document?Hast never known a man nor proved his word's intent?Is't not enough that what I speak to-dayShall stand with all my future days agreeing?In all its tides sweeps not the world awayAnd shall a promise bind my being?Yet this delusion in our hearts we bear:Who would himself therefrom deliver?Blest he whose bosom Truth makes pure and fair!No sacrifice shall he repent of ever.Nathless a parchment writ and stamped with careA spectre is which all to shun endeavor.The word alas! dies even in the penAnd wax and leather keep the lordship then.What wilt from me Base Spirit say?--Brass marble parchment paper clay?The terms with graver quill or chisel stated?I freely leave the choice to thee.,faust
Why heat thyself thus instantlyWith eloquence exaggerated?Each leaf for such a pact is good;And to subscribe thy name thou'lt take a drop of blood.,faust
Fear not that I this pact shall seek to sever?The promise that I make to theeIs just the sum of my endeavor.I have myself inflated all too high;My proper place is thy estate:The Mighty Spirit deigns me no replyAnd Nature shuts on me her gate.The thread of Thought at last is brokenAnd knowledge brings disgust unspoken.Let us the sensual deeps exploreTo quench the fervors of glowing passion!Let every marvel take form and fashionThrough the impervious veil it wore!Plunge we in Time's tumultuous danceIn the rush and roll of Circumstance!Then may delight and distressAnd worry and successAlternately follow as best they can:Restless activity proves the man!,faust
For you no bound no term is set.Whether you everywhere be tryingOr snatch a rapid bliss in flyingMay it agree with you what you get!Only fall to and show no timid balking.,faust
But thou hast heard 'tis not of joy we're talking.I take the wildering whirl enjoyment's keenest painEnamored hate exhilarant disdain.My bosom of its thirst for knowledge satedShall not henceforth from any pang be wrestedAnd all of life for all mankind createdShall be within mine inmost being tested:The highest lowest forms my soul shall borrowShall heap upon itself their bliss and sorrowAnd thus my own sole self to all their selves expandedI too at last shall with them all be stranded!,faust
Believe me who for many a thousand yearThe same tough meat have chewed and testedThat from the cradle to the bierNo man the ancient leaven has digested!Trust one of us this Whole supernalIs made but for a God's delight!_He_ dwells in splendor single and eternalBut _us_ he thrusts in darkness out of sightAnd _you_ he dowers with Day and Night.,faust
A good reply!One only fear still needs repeating:The art is long the time is fleeting.Then let thyself be taught say I!Go league thyself with a poetGive the rein to his imaginationThen wear the crown and show itOf the qualities of his creation--The courage of the lion's breedThe wild stag's speedThe Italian's fiery bloodThe North's firm fortitude!Let him find for thee the secret tetherThat binds the Noble and Mean together.And teach thy pulses of youth and pleasureTo love by rule and hate by measure!I'd like myself such a one to see:Sir Microcosm his name should be.,faust
What am I then if 'tis denied my partThe crown of all humanity to win meWhereto yearns every sense within me?,faust
Why on the whole thou'rt--what thou art.Set wigs of million curls upon thy head to raise theeWear shoes an ell in height--the truth betrays theeAnd thou remainest--what thou art.,faust
I feel indeed that I have made the treasureOf human thought and knowledge mine in vain;And if I now sit down in restful leisureNo fount of newer strength is in my brain:I am no hair's-breadth more in heightNor nearer to the Infinite,faust
Good Sir you see the facts preciselyAs they are seen by each and all.We must arrange them now more wiselyBefore the joys of life shall pall.Why Zounds! Both hands and feet are truly--And head and virile forces--thine:Yet all that I indulge in newlyIs't thence less wholly mine?If I've six stallions in my stallAre not their forces also lent me?I speed along completest man of allAs though my legs were four-and-twenty.Take hold then! let reflection restAnd plunge into the world with zest!I say to thee a speculative wightIs like a beast on moorlands leanThat round and round some fiend misleads to evil plightWhile all about lie pastures fresh and green.,faust
We'll try a wider sphere.What place of martyrdom is here!Is't life I ask is't even prudenceTo bore thyself and bore the students?Let Neighbor Paunch to that attend!Why plague thyself with threshing straw forever?The best thou learnest in the endThou dar'st not tell the youngsters--never!I hear one's footsteps hither steering.,faust
So long the poor boy waits a hearingHe must not unconsoled depart.Thy cap and mantle straightway lend me!I'll play the comedy with art.,faust
My wits be certain will befriend me.But fifteen minutes' time is all I need;For our fine trip meanwhile prepare thyself with speed!,faust
Reason and Knowledge only thou despiseThe highest strength in man that lies!Let but the Lying Spirit bind theeWith magic works and shows that blind theeAnd I shall have thee fast and sure!--Fate such a bold untrammelled spirit gave himAs forwards onwards ever must endure;Whose over-hasty impulse drave himPast earthly joys he might secure.Dragged through the wildest life will I enslave himThrough flat and stale indifference;With struggling chilling checking so deprave himThat to his hot insatiate senseThe dream of drink shall mock but never lave him:Refreshment shall his lips in vain implore--Had he not made himself the Devil's naught could savehimStill were he lost forevermore!,faust
A short time only am I hereAnd come devoted and sincereTo greet and know the man of fameWhom men to me with reverence name.,faust
Receive me now I pray as oneWho comes to you with courage goodSomewhat of cash and healthy blood:My mother was hardly willing to let me;But knowledge worth having I fain would get me.,faust
I'd like to leave it I must avow;I find these walls these vaulted spacesAre anything but pleasant places.Tis all so cramped and close and mean;One sees no tree no glimpse of greenAnd when the lecture-halls receive meSeeing hearing and thinking leave me.,faust
All that depends on habitude.So from its mother's breasts a childAt first reluctant takes its foodBut soon to seek them is beguiled.Thus at the breasts of Wisdom clingingThou'lt find each day a greater rapture bringing.,faust
I crave the highest erudition;And fain would make my acquisitionAll that there is in Earth and HeavenIn Nature and in Science too.,faust
Body and soul thereon I'll wreak;Yet truly I've some inclinationOn summer holidays to seekA little freedom and recreation.,faust
Your mind will shortly be set arightWhen you have learned all things reducingTo classify them for your using.,faust
And after--first and foremost duty--OfMetaphysics learn the use and beauty!See that you most profoundly gainWhat does not suit the human brain!A splendid word to serve you'll findFor what goes in--or won't go in--your mind.But first at least this half a yearTo order rigidly adhere;Five hours a day you understandAnd when the clock strikes be on hand!Prepare beforehand for your partWith paragraphs all got by heartSo you can better watch and lookThat naught is said but what is in the book:Yet in thy writing as unwearied beAs did the Holy Ghost dictate to thee!,faust
No need to tell me twice to do it!I think how useful 'tis to write;For what one has in black and whiteOne carries home and then goes through it.,faust
Nor can I therefore greatly blame you students:I know what science this has come to be.All rights and laws are still transmittedLike an eternal sickness of the race--From generation unto generation fittedAnd shifted round from place to place.Reason becomes a sham Beneficence a worry:Thou art a grandchild therefore woe to thee!The right born with us ours in verityThis to consider there's alas! no hurry.,faust
My own disgust is strengthened by your speech:O lucky he whom you shall teach!I've almost for Theology decided.,faust
I should not wish to see you here misguided:For as regards this science let me hint'Tis very hard to shun the false direction;There's so much secret poison lurking in 'tSo like the medicine it baffles your detection.Hear therefore one alone for that is best in soothAnd simply take your master's words for truth.On _words_ let your attention centre!Then through the safest gate you'll enterThe temple-halls of Certainty.,faust
Of course! But only shun too over-sharp a tensionFor just where fails the comprehensionA word steps promptly in as deputy.With words 'tis excellent disputing;Systems to words 'tis easy suiting;On words 'tis excellent believing;No word can ever lose a jot from thieving.,faust
Pardon! With many questions I detain you.Yet must I trouble you again.Of Medicine I still would fainHear one strong word that might explain you.Three years is but a little space.And God! who can the field embrace?If one some index could be shown'Twere easier groping forward truly.,faust
To grasp the spirit of Medicine is easy:Learn of the great and little world your fillTo let it go at last so please yeJust as God will!In vain that through the realms of science you may drift;Each one learns only--just what learn he can:Yet he who grasps the Moment's giftHe is the proper man.Well-made you are 'tis not to be deniedThe rest a bold address will win you;If you but in yourself confideAt once confide all others in you.To lead the women learn the special feeling!Their everlasting aches and groansIn thousand tonesHave all one source one mode of healing;And if your acts are half discreetYou'll always have them at your feet.A title first must draw and interest themAnd show that yours all other arts exceeds;Then as a greeting you are free to touch and test themWhile thus to do for years another pleads.You press and count the pulse's dancesAnd then with burning sidelong glancesYou clasp the swelling hips to seeIf tightly laced her corsets be.,faust
I swear to you 'tis like a dream to me.Might I again presume with trust unboundedTo hear your wisdom thoroughly expounded?,faust
I cannot really go away:Allow me that my album first I reach you--Grant me this favor I beseech you!,faust
Follow the ancient text and the snake thou wast ordered to trample!With all thy likeness to God thou'lt yet be a sorry example!,faust
As best it pleases thee.The little world and then the great we'll see.With what delight what profit winningShalt thou sponge through the term beginning!,faust
Yet with the flowing beard I wearBoth ease and grace will fail me there.The attempt indeed were a futile strife;I never could learn the ways of life.I feel so small before others and thenceShould always find embarrassments.,faust
My friend thou soon shalt lose all such misgiving:Be thou but self-possessed thou hast the art of living!,faust
We'll spread this cloak with proper artThen through the air direct our courses.But only on so bold a flightBe sure to have thy luggage light.A little burning air which I shall soon prepare usAbove the earth will nimbly bear usAnd if we're light we'll travel swift and clear:I gratulate thee on thy new career!,faust
Is no one laughing? no one drinking?I'll teach you how to grin I'm thinking.To-day you're like wet straw so tame;And usually you're all aflame.,faust

     There was a rat in the cellar-nest     Whom fat and butter made smoother:     He had a paunch beneath his vest     Like that of Doctor Luther.     The cook laid poison cunningly     And then as sore oppressed was he     As if he had love in his bosom.,faust
     He ran around he ran about     His thirst in puddles laving;     He gnawed and scratched the house throughout.     But nothing cured his raving.     He whirled and jumped with torment mad     And soon enough the poor beast had     As if he had love in his bosom.,faust
     And driven at last in open day     He ran into the kitchen     Fell on the hearth and squirming lay     In the last convulsion twitching.     Then laughed the murderess in her glee:     "Ha! ha! he's at his last gasp" said she     "As if he had love in his bosom!",faust

Before all else I bring thee hitherWhere boon companions meet togetherTo let thee see how smooth life runs away.Here for the folk each day's a holiday:With little wit and ease to suit themThey whirl in narrow circling trailsLike kittens playing with their tails?And if no headache persecute themSo long the host may credit giveThey merrily and careless live.,faust

     There was a king once reigning     Who had a big black flea     And loved him past explaining     As his own son were he.     He called his man of stitches;     The tailor came straightway:     Here measure the lad for breeches.     And measure his coat I say!,faust

     And the lords and ladies of honor     Were plagued awake and in bed;     The queen she got them upon her     The maids were bitten and bled.     And they did not dare to brush them     Or scratch them day or night:     We crack them and we crush them     At once whene'er they bite.,faust

I brought it up and it was fond of me.Father had died before it saw the lightAnd mother's case seemed hopeless quiteSo weak and miserable she lay;And she recovered then so slowly day by day.She could not think herself of givingThe poor wee thing its natural living;And so I nursed it all aloneWith milk and water: 'twas my own.Lulled in my lap with many a songIt smiled and tumbled and grew strong.,faust
But surely also many a weary hour.I kept the baby's cradle nearMy bed at night: if 't even stirred I'd guess itAnd waking hear.And I must nurse it warm beside me press itAnd oft to quiet it my bed forsakeAnd dandling back and forth the restless creature takeThen at the wash-tub stand at morning's break;And then the marketing and kitchen-tendingDay after day the same thing never-ending.One's spirits Sir are thus not always goodBut then one learns to relish rest and food.,faust

O tremble not! but let this lookLet this warm clasp of hands declare theeWhat is unspeakable!To yield one wholly and to feel a raptureIn yielding that must be eternal!Eternal!--for the end would be despair.No no--no ending! no ending!,faust
I'd ask you longer here to tarryBut evil tongues in this town have full play.It's as if nobody had nothing to fetch and carryNor other laborBut spying all the doings of one's neighbor:And one becomes the talk do whatsoe'er one may.Where is our couple now?,faust
(MARGARET _comes in conceals herself behind the door puts herfinger to her lips and peeps through the crack_.),faust
Dear God! However is it suchA man can think and know so much?I stand ashamed and in amazeAnd answer "Yes" to all he saysA poor unknowing child! and he--I can't think what he finds in me! [_Exit_.,faust
Spirit sublime thou gav'st me gav'st me allFor which I prayed. Not unto me in vainHast thou thy countenance revealed in fire.Thou gav'st me Nature as a kingdom grandWith power to feel and to enjoy it. ThouNot only cold amazed acquaintance yield'stBut grantest that in her profoundest breastI gaze as in the bosom of a friend.The ranks of living creatures thou dost leadBefore me teaching me to know my brothersIn air and water and the silent wood.And when the storm in forests roars and grindsThe giant firs in falling neighbor boughsAnd neighbor trunks with crushing weight bear downAnd falling fill the hills with hollow thunders--Then to the cave secure thou leadest meThen show'st me mine own self and in my breastThe deep mysterious miracles unfold.And when the perfect moon before my gazeComes up with soothing light around me floatFrom every precipice and thicket dampThe silvery phantoms of the ages pastAnd temper the austere delight of thought.,faust
That nothing can be perfect unto ManI now am conscious. With this ecstasyWhich brings me near and nearer to the GodsThou gav'st the comrade whom I now no moreCan do without though cold and scornful heDemeans me to myself and with a breathA word transforms thy gifts to nothingness.Within my breast he fans a lawless fireUnwearied for that fair and lovely form:Thus in desire I hasten to enjoymentAnd in enjoyment pine to feel desire.,faust
Have you not led this life quite long enough?How can a further test delight you?'Tis very well that once one tries the stuffBut something new must then requite you.,faust
Well! I'll engage to let thee be:Thou darest not tell me so in earnest.The loss of thee were truly very slight--comrade crazy rude repelling:,faust
One has one's hands full all the day and night;If what one does or leaves undone is rightFrom such a face as thine there is no telling.,faust
Poor Son of Earth how couldst thou thus aloneHave led thy life bereft of me?I for a time at least have worked thy cure;Thy fancy's rickets plague thee not at all:Had I not been so hadst thou sureWalked thyself off this earthly ballWhy here to caverns rocky hollows slinkingSit'st thou as 'twere an owl a-blinking?Why suck'st from sodden moss and dripping stoneToad-like thy nourishment alone?A fine way this thy time to fill!The Doctor's in thy body still.,faust
What fresh and vital forces canst thou guessSpring from my commerce with the wilderness?But if thou hadst the power of guessingThou wouldst be devil enough to grudge my soul the blessing.,faust
A blessing drawn from supernatural fountains!In night and dew to lie upon the mountains;All Heaven and Earth in rapture penetrating;Thyself to Godhood haughtily inflating;To grub with yearning force through Earth's dark marrowCompress the six days' work within thy bosom narrow--To taste I know not what in haughty powerThine own ecstatic life on all things showerThine earthly self behind thee castAnd then the lofty instinct thus--,faust
Get thee away with thine offencesReprobate! Name not that fairest thingNor the desire for her sweet body bringAgain before my half-distracted senses!,faust
Yet am I near and love keeps watch and ward;Though I were ne'er so far it cannot falter:I envy even the Body of the LordThe touching of her lips before the altar.,faust
You rail and it is fun to me.The God who fashioned youth and maidPerceived the noblest purpose of His tradeAnd also made their opportunity.Go on! It is a woe profound!'Tis for your sweetheart's room you're boundAnd not for death indeed.,faust
What are within her arms the heavenly blisses?Though I be glowing with her kissesDo I not always share her need?I am the fugitive all houseless roamingThe monster without air or restThat like a cataract down rocks and gorges foamingLeaps maddened into the abyss's breast!And side-wards she with young unwakened sensesWithin her cabin on the Alpine fieldHer simple homely life commencesHer little world therein concealed.And I God's hate flung o'er meHad not enough to thrustThe stubborn rocks before meAnd strike them into dust!She and her peace I yet must undermine:Thou Hell hast claimed this sacrifice as thine!Help Devil! through the coming pangs to push me;What must be let it quickly be!Let fall on me her fate and also crush me--One ruin whelm both her and me!,faust
Again it seethes again it glows!Thou fool go in and comfort her!When such a head as thine no outlet knowsIt thinks the end must soon occur.Hail him who keeps a steadfast mind!Thou else dost well the devil-nature wear:Naught so insipid in the world I findAs is a devil in despair.,faust
        My peace is gone        My heart is sore:        I never shall find it        Ah nevermore!,faust

        My poor weak head        Is racked and crazed;        My thought is lost        My senses mazed.,faust

        My bosom yearns        For him alone;        Ah dared I clasp him        And hold and own!,faust
        And kiss his mouth        To heart's desire        And on his kisses        At last expire!,faust
How is't with thy religion pray?Thou art a dear good-hearted manAnd yet I think dost not incline that way.,faust
Leave that my child! Thou know'st my love is tender;For love my blood and life would I surrenderAnd as for Faith and Church I grant to each his own.,faust
Desiring no possession'Tis long since thou hast been to mass or to confession.Believest thou in God?,faust
My darling who shall dare"I believe in God!" to say?Ask priest or sage the answer to declareAnd it will seem a mocking playA sarcasm on the asker.,faust
Hear me not falsely sweetest countenance!Who dare express Him?And who profess HimSaying: I believe in Him!Who feeling seeingDeny His beingSaying: I believe Him not!The All-enfoldingThe All-upholdingFolds and upholds he notThee me Himself?Arches not there the sky above us?Lies not beneath us firm the earth?And rise not on us shiningFriendly the everlasting stars?Look I not eye to eye on theeAnd feel'st not throngingTo head and heart the forceStill weaving its eternal secretInvisible visible round thy life?Vast as it is fill with that force thy heartAnd when thou in the feeling wholly blessed artCall it then what thou wilt--Call it Bliss! Heart! Love! God!I have no name to give it!Feeling is all in all:The Name is sound and smokeObscuring Heaven's clear glow.,faust
All that is fine and good to hear it so:Much the same way the preacher spokeOnly with slightly different phrases.,faust
The same thing in all placesAll hearts that beat beneath the heavenly day--Each in its language--say;Then why not I in mine as well?,faust
To hear it thus it may seem passable;And yet some hitch in't there must beFor thou hast no Christianity.,faust
        The man who with thee goes thy mateWithin my deepest inmost soul I hate.In all my life there's nothingHas given my heart so keen a pang of loathingAs his repulsive face has done.,faust
I feel his presence like something ill.I've else for all a kindly willBut much as my heart to see thee yearnethThe secret horror of him returneth;And I think the man a knave as I live!If I do him wrong may God forgive!,faust
Live with the like of him may I never!When once inside the door comes heHe looks around so sneeringlyAnd half in wrath:One sees that in nothing no interest he hath:'Tis written on his very foreheadThat love to him is a thing abhorréd.I am so happy on thine armSo free so yielding and so warmAnd in his presence stifled seems my heart.,faust
It overcomes me in such degreeThat wheresoe'er he meets us evenI feel as though I'd lost my love for thee.When he is by I could not pray to Heaven.That burns within me like a flameAnd surely Henry 'tis with thee the same.,faust
                Ah shall there never beA quiet hour to see us fondly plightedWith breast to breast and soul to soul united?,faust
Ah if I only slept alone!I'd draw the bolts to-night for thy desire;But mother's sleep so light has grownAnd if we were discovered by her'Twould be my death upon the spot!,faust
Thou angel fear it not!Here is a phial: in her drinkBut three drops of it measureAnd deepest sleep will on her senses sink.,faust
Ah dearest man if but thy face I seeI know not what compels me to thy will:So much have I already done for theeThat scarcely more is left me to fulfil.,faust
I've heard most fully how she drew thee.The Doctor has been catechised 'tis plain;Great good I hope the thing will do thee.The girls have much desire to ascertainIf one is prim and good as ancient rules compel:If there he's led they think he'll follow them as well.,faust
Thou monster wilt nor see nor ownHow this pure soul of faith so lowlySo loving and ineffable--The faith aloneThat her salvation is--with scruples holyPines lest she hold as lost the man she loves so well!,faust
And then how masterly she reads physiognomy!When I am present she's impressed she knows not how;She in my mask a hidden sense would read:She feels that surely I'm a genius now--Perhaps the very Devil indeed!Well well--to-night--?,faust
It's true Sibylla said to-day.She's played the fool at last there's not a doubt.Such taking-on of airs!,faust
    And so at last it serves her rightly.She clung to the fellow so long and tightly!That was a promenading!At village and dance parading!As the first they must everywhere shineAnd he treated her always to pies and wineAnd she made a to-do with her face so fine;So mean and shameless was her behaviorShe took all the presents the fellow gave her.'Twas kissing and coddling on and on!So now at the end the flower is gone.,faust
                      Dost pity her at that?When one of us at spinning satAnd mother nights ne'er let us out the doorShe sported with her paramour.On the door-bench in the passage darkThe length of the time they'd never mark.So now her head no more she'll liftBut do church-penance in her sinner's shift!,faust
If him she gets why let her beware!The boys shall dash her wreath on the floorAnd we'll scatter chaff before her door!                                              [_Exit_.,faust
How scornfully I once reviledWhen some poor maiden was beguiled!More speech than any tongue sufficesI craved to censure others' vices.Black as it seemed I blackened stillAnd blacker yet was in my will;And blessed myself and boasted high--And now--a living sin am I!Yet--all that drove my heart theretoGod! was so good so dear so true!,faust

        Help! rescue me from death and stain!        O Maiden!        Thou sorrow-laden        Incline Thy countenance upon my pain!,faust
When I have sat at some carouse.Where each to each his brag allowsAnd many a comrade praised to meHis pink of girls right lustilyWith brimming glass that spilled the toastAnd elbows planted as in boast:I sat in unconcerned reposeAnd heard the swagger as it rose.And stroking then my beard I'd saySmiling the bumper in my hand:"Each well enough in her own way.But is there one in all the landLike sister Margaret good as gold--One that to her can a candle hold?"Cling! clang! "Here's to her!" went aroundThe board: "He speaks the truth!" cried some;"In her the flower o' the sex is found!"And all the swaggerers were dumb.And now!--I could tear my hair with vexation.And dash out my brains in desperation!With turned-up nose each scamp may face meWith sneers and stinging taunts disgrace meAnd like a bankrupt debtor sittingA chance-dropped word may set me sweating!Yet though I thresh them all togetherI cannot call them liars either.,faust
But what comes sneaking there to view?If I mistake not there are two.If _he's_ one let me at him drive!He shall not leave the spot alive.,faust
How from the window of the sacristyUpward th'eternal lamp sends forth a glimmerThat lessening side-wards fainter grows and dimmerTill darkness closes from the sky!The shadows thus within my bosom gather.,faust
I'm like a sentimental tom-cat ratherThat round the tall fire-ladders sweepsAnd stealthy then along the coping creeps:Quite virtuous withal I comeA little thievish and a little frolicsome.I feel in every limb the presageForerunning the grand Walpurgis-Night:Day after to-morrow brings its messageAnd one keeps watch then with delight.,faust
Shalt soon experience the pleasureTo lift the kettle with its treasure.I lately gave therein a squint--Saw splendid lion-dollars in 't.,faust

So long as in my legs I feel the fresh existence.This knotted staff suffices me.What need to shorten so the way?Along this labyrinth of vales to wanderThen climb the rocky ramparts yonderWherefrom the fountain flings eternal sprayIs such delight my steps would fain delay.The spring-time stirs within the fragrant birchesAnd even the fir-tree feels it now:Should then our limbs escape its gentle searches?,faust
I notice no such thing I vow!'Tis winter still within my body:Upon my path I wish for frost and snow.How sadly rises incomplete and ruddyThe moon's lone disk with its belated glowAnd lights so dimly that as one advancesAt every step one strikes a rock or tree!Let us then use a Jack-o'-lantern's glances:I see one yonder burning merrily.Ho there! my friend!

     We it seems have entered newly     In the sphere of dreams enchanted.     Do thy bidding guide us truly     That our feet be forwards planted     In the vast the desert spaces!     See them swiftly changing places     Trees on trees beside us trooping     And the crags above us stooping     And the rocky snouts outgrowing--     Hear them snoring hear them blowing!     O'er the stones the grasses flowing     Stream and streamlet seek the hollow.     Hear I noises? songs that follow?     Hear I tender love-petitions?     Voices of those heavenly visions?     Sounds of hope of love undying!     And the echoes like traditions     Of old days come faint and hollow.,faust
     Hoo-hoo! Shoo-hoo! Nearer hover     Jay and screech-owl and the plover--     Are they all awake and crying?     Is't the salamander pushes     Bloated-bellied through the bushes?     And the roots like serpents twisted     Through the sand and boulders toiling     Fright us weirdest links uncoiling     To entrap us unresisted:     Living knots and gnarls uncanny     Feel with polypus-antennae     For the wanderer. Mice are flying     Thousand-colored herd-wise hieing     Through the moss and through the heather!,faust

How strangely glimmers through the hollowsA dreary light like that of dawn!Its exhalation tracks and followsThe deepest gorges faint and wan.Here steam there rolling vapor sweepeth;Here burns the glow through film and haze:Now like a tender thread it creepethNow like a fountain leaps and plays.Here winds away and in a hundredDivided veins the valley braids:There in a corner pressed and sunderedItself detaches spreads and fades.Here gush the sparkles incandescentLike scattered showers of golden sand;--But see! in all their height at presentThe rocky ramparts blazing stand.,faust

Under the old ribs of the rock retreatingHold fast lest thou be hurled down the abysses there!The night with the mist is black;Hark! how the forests grind and crack!Frightened the owlets are scattered:Hearken! the pillars are shattered.The evergreen palaces shaking!Boughs are groaning and breakingThe tree-trunks terribly thunderThe roots are twisting asunder!In frightfully intricate crashingEach on the other is dashingAnd over the wreck-strewn gorgesThe tempest whistles and surges!Hear'st thou voices higher ringing?Far away or nearer singing?Yes the mountain's side alongSweeps an infuriate glamouring song!,faust

Aloft we'd fain ourselves betake.We've washed and are bright as ever you willYet we're eternally sterile still.,faust

So long I stumble ill besteadAnd the others are now so far ahead!At home I've neither rest nor cheerAnd yet I cannot gain them here.,faust
     To cheer the witch will salve avail;     A rag will answer for a sail;     Each trough a goodly ship supplies;     He ne'er will fly who now not flies.,faust
     When round the summit whirls our flight     Then lower and on the ground alight;     And far and wide the heather press     With witchhood's swarms of wantonness!,faust
They crowd and push they roar and clatter!They whirl and whistle pull and chatter!They shine and spirt and stink and burn!The true witch-element we learn.Keep close! or we are parted in our turnWhere art thou?,faust
What! whirled so far astray?Then house-right I must use and clear the way.Make room! Squire Voland comes! Room gentle rabbleroom!,faust
Here Doctor hold to me: in one jump we'll resumeAn easier space and from the crowd be free:It's too much even for the like of me.Yonder with special light there's something shining clearerWithin those bushes; I've a mind to see.Come on! we'll slip a little nearer.,faust
Spirit of Contradiction! On! I'll follow straight.'Tis planned most wisely if I judge aright:We climb the Brocken's top in the Walpurgis-NightThat arbitrarily here ourselves we isolate.,faust

Better the summit I must own:There fire and whirling smoke I see.They seek the Evil One in wild confusion:Many enigmas there might find solution.,faust
But there enigmas also knotted be.Leave to the multitude their riot!Here will we house ourselves in quiet.It is an old transmitted tradeThat in the greater world the little worlds are made.I see stark-nude young witches congregateAnd old ones veiled and hidden shrewdly:On my account be kind nor treat them rudely!The trouble's small the fun is great.I hear the noise of instruments attuning--Vile din! yet one must learn to bear the crooning.Come come along! It _must_ be I declare!I'll go ahead and introduce thee thereThine obligation newly earning.That is no little space: what say'st thou friend?Look yonder! thou canst scarcely see the end:A hundred fires along the ranks are burning.They dance they chat they cook they drink they court:Now where just tell me is there better sport?,faust
I'm mostly used 'tis true to go incognitoBut on a gala-day one may his orders show.The Garter does not deck my suitBut honored and at home is here the cloven foot.Perceiv'st thou yonder snail?

O everywhere on him you fall!When others dance he weighs the matter:If he can't every step bechatterThen 'tis the same as were the step not made;But if you forwards go his ire is most displayed.If you would whirl in regular gyrationAs he does in his dull old millHe'd show at any rate good-will--Especially if you heard and heeded his hortation.,faust
You still are here? Nay 'tis a thing unheard!Vanish at once! We've said the enlightening word.The pack of devils by no rules is daunted:We are so wise and yet is Tegel haunted.To clear the folly out how have I swept and stirred!Twill ne'er be clean: why 'tis a thing unheard!,faust
I tell you spirits to your faceI give to spirit-despotism no place;My spirit cannot practise it at all.,faust
Naught will succeed I see amid such revels;Yet something from a tour I always saveAnd hope before my last step to the graveTo overcome the poets and the devils.,faust
He now will seat him in the nearest puddle;The solace this whereof he's most assured:And when upon his rump the leeches hang and fuddleHe'll be of spirits and of Spirit cured.,faust
That's nothing! One must not so squeamish be;So the mouse was not gray enough for thee.Who'd think of that in love's selected season?,faust
Mephisto seest thou thereAlone and far a girl most pale and fair?She falters on her way scarce knowingAs if with fettered feet that stay her going.I must confess it seems to meAs if my kindly Margaret were she.,faust
Let the thing be! All thence have evil drawn:It is a magic shape a lifeless eidolon.Such to encounter is not good:Their blank set stare benumbs the human bloodAnd one is almost turned to stone.Medusa's tale to thee is known.,faust
Forsooth the eyes they are of one whom dyingNo hand with loving pressure closed;That is the breast whereon I once was lying--The body sweet beside which I reposed!,faust
The woe the rapture so ensnare meThat from her gaze I cannot tear me!And strange! around her fairest throatA single scarlet band is gleamingNo broader than a knife-blade seeming!,faust
Quite right! The mark I also note.Her head beneath her arm she'll sometimes carry;Twas Perseus lopped it her old adversary.Thou crav'st the same illusion still!Come let us mount this little hill;The Prater shows no livelier stirAnd if they've not bewitched my senseI verily see a theatre.What's going on?,faust
SERVIBILIS                 'Twill shortly recommence:A new performance--'tis the last of seven.To give that number is the custom here:'Twas by a Dilettante writtenAnd Dilettanti in the parts appear.That now I vanish pardon I entreat you!As Dilettante I the curtain raise.,faust
Sons of Mieding rest to-day!Needless your machinery:Misty vale and mountain grayThat is all the scenery.,faust
That the wedding golden be.Must fifty years be rounded:But _the Golden_ give to meWhen the strife's compounded.,faust
Spirits if you're here be seen--Show yourselves delighted!Fairy king and fairy queenThey are newly plighted.,faust
Cometh Puck and light of limbWhisks and whirls in measure:Come a hundred after himTo share with him the pleasure.,faust
Ariel's song is heavenly-pureHis tones are sweet and rare ones:Though ugly faces he allureYet he allures the fair ones.,faust
Spouses who would fain agreeLearn how we were mated!If your pairs would loving beFirst be separated!,faust
If her whims the wife controlAnd the man berate herTake him to the Northern PoleAnd her to the Equator!,faust
Snout of fly mosquito-billAnd kin of all conditionsFrog in grass and cricket-trill--These are the musicians!,faust
See the bagpipe on our track!'Tis the soap-blown bubble:Hear the _schnecke-schnicke-schnack_Through his nostrils double!,faust
Spider's foot and paunch of toadAnd little wings--we know 'em!A little creature 'twill not beBut yet a little poem.,faust
Little step and lofty leapThrough honey-dew and fragrance:You'll never mount the airy steepWith all your tripping vagrance.,faust
I only seize with sketchy airSome outlines of the tourney;Yet I betimes myself prepareFor my Italian journey.,faust
My bad luck brings me here alas!How roars the orgy louder!And of the witches in the massBut only two wear powder.,faust
Powder becomes like petticoatA gray and wrinkled noddy;So I sit naked on my goatAnd show a strapping body.,faust
We've too much tact and policyTo rate with gibes a scolder;Yet young and tender though you beI hope to see you moulder.,faust
Fly-snout and mosquito-billDon't swarm so round the Naked!Frog in grass and cricket-trillObserve the time and make it!,faust
Society to one's desire!Brides only and the sweetest!And bachelors of youth and fire.And prospects the completest!,faust
And if the Earth don't open nowTo swallow up each ranterWhy then will I myself I vowJump into hell instanter!,faust
Us as little insects see!With sharpest nippers flittingThat our Papa Satan weMay honor as is fitting.,faust
How in crowds together massedThey are jesting shameless!They will even say at lastThat their hearts are blameless.,faust
Among this witches' revelryHis way one gladly loses;And truly it would easier beThan to command the Muses.,faust
The proper folks one's talents laud:Come on and none shall pass us!The Blocksberg has a summit broadLike Germany's Parnassus.,faust
Say who's the stiff and pompous man?He walks with haughty paces:He snuffles all he snuffle can:"He scents the Jesuits' traces.",faust
Both clear and muddy streams for meAre good to fish and sport in:And thus the pious man you seeWith even devils consorting.,faust
Yes for the pious I suspectAll instruments are fitting;And on the Blocksberg they erectFull many a place of meeting.,faust
A newer chorus now succeeds!I hear the distant drumming."Don't be disturbed! 'tis in the reedsThe bittern's changeless booming.",faust
How each his legs in nimble tripLifts up and makes a clearance!The crooked jump the heavy skipNor care for the appearance.,faust
The rabble by such hate are heldTo maim and slay delights them:As Orpheus' lyre the brutes compelledThe bagpipe here unites them.,faust
I'll not be led by any lureOf doubts or critic-cavils:The Devil must be something sure--Or how should there be devils?,faust
This once the fancy wrought in meIs really too despotic:Forsooth if I am all I seeI must be idiotic!,faust
This racking fuss on every handIt gives me great vexation;And for the first time here I standOn insecure foundation.,faust
With much delight I see the playAnd grant to these their meritsSince from the devils I also mayInfer the better spirits.,faust
The flame they follow on and onAnd think they're near the treasure:But _Devil_ rhymes with _Doubt_ aloneSo I am here with pleasure.,faust
Frog in green and cricket-trill.Such dilettants!--perdition!Fly-snout and mosquito-bill--Each one's a fine musician!,faust
_Sans souci_ we call the clanOf merry creatures so then;Go a-foot no more we canAnd on our heads we go then.,faust
Once many a bit we sponged but nowGod help us! that is done with:Our shoes are all danced out we trowWe've but naked soles to run with.,faust
From the marshes we appearWhere we originated;Yet in the ranks at once we're hereAs glittering gallants rated.,faust
Darting hither from the skyIn star and fire light shootingCross-wise now in grass I lie:Who'll help me to my footing?,faust
Room! and round about us room!Trodden are the grasses:Spirits also spirits comeAnd they are bulky masses.,faust
Enter not so stall-fed quiteLike elephant-calves about one!And the heaviest weight to-nightBe Puck himself the stout one!,faust
If loving Nature at your backOr Mind the wings unclosesFollow up my airy trackTo the mount of roses!,faust
_pianissimo_Cloud and trailing mist o'erheadAre now illuminated:Air in leaves and wind in reedAnd all is dissipated.,faust
In misery! In despair! Long wretchedly astray on the face of the earthand now imprisoned! That gracious ill-starred creature shut in adungeon as a criminal and given up to fearful torments! To this has itcome! to this!--Treacherous contemptible spirit and thou hastconcealed it from me!--Stand then--stand! Roll the devilish eyeswrathfully in thy head! Stand and defy me with thine intolerablepresence! Imprisoned! In irretrievable misery! Delivered up to evilspirits and to condemning unfeeling Man! And thou hast lulled memeanwhile with the most insipid dissipations hast concealed from meher increasing wretchedness and suffered her to go helplessly to ruin![Illustration: _Roll the devilish eyes wrathfully in thy head_],faust
Dog! Abominable monster! Transform him thou Infinite Spirit! transformthe reptile again into his dog-shape? in which it pleased him often atnight to scamper on before me to roll himself at the feet of theunsuspecting wanderer and hang upon his shoulders when he fell!Transform him again into his favorite likeness that he may crawl uponhis belly in the dust before me--that I may trample him the outlawedunder foot! Not the first! O woe! woe which no human soul can graspthat more than one being should sink into the depths of thismisery--that the first in its writhing death-agony under the eyes ofthe Eternal Forgiver did not expiate the guilt of all others! Themisery of this single one pierces to the very marrow of my life; andthou art calmly grinning at the fate of thousands!,faust
Now we are already again at the end of our wits where the understandingof you men runs wild. Why didst thou enter into fellowship with us ifthou canst not carry it out? Wilt fly and art not secure againstdizziness? Did we thrust ourselves upon thee or thou thyself upon us?,faust
Gnash not thus thy devouring teeth at me? It fills me with horribledisgust. Mighty glorious Spirit who hast vouchsafed to me Thineapparition who knowest my heart and my soul why fetter me to thefelon-comrade who feeds on mischief and gluts himself with ruin?,faust
I cannot loosen the bonds of the Avenger nor undo his bolts. Rescueher? Who was it that plunged her into ruin? I or thou?,faust
Wilt thou grasp the thunder? Well that it has not been given to youmiserable mortals! To crush to pieces the innocent respondent--that isthe tyrant-fashion of relieving one's self in embarrassments.,faust
And the danger to which thou wilt expose thyself? Know that the guilt ofblood from thy hand still lies upon the town! Avenging spirits hoverover the spot where the victim fell and lie in wait for the returningmurderer.,faust
That too from thee? Murder and death of a world upon thee monster!Take me thither I say and liberate her!,faust
I will convey thee there; and hear what I can do! Have I all the powerin Heaven and on Earth? I will becloud the jailer's senses: getpossession of the key and lead her forth with human hand! I will keepwatch: the magic steeds are ready I will carry you off. So much is inmy power.,faust
A shudder long unfelt comes o'er me;Mankind's collected woe o'erwhelms me here.She dwells within the dark damp walls before meAnd all her crime was a delusion dear!What! I delay to free her?I dread once again to see her?On! my shrinking but lingers Death more near.,faust
     _My mother the harlot     Who put me to death;     My father the varlet     Who eaten me hath!     Little sister so good     Laid my bones in the wood     In the damp moss and clay:_     _Then was I a beautiful bird o' the wood;     Fly away! Fly away_!,faust
FAUSTThy cries will wake the guards and they will seize thee!(_He takes hold of the fetters to unlock them_.),faust
Who headsman! unto thee such powerOver me could give?Thou'rt come for me at midnight-hour:Have mercy on me let me live!Is't not soon enough when morning chime has run?,faust
And I am yet so young so young!And now Death comes and ruin!I too was fair and that was my undoing.My love was near but now he's far;Torn lies the wreath scattered the blossoms are.Seize me not thus so violently!Spare me! What have I done to thee?Let me not vainly entreat thee!I never chanced in all my days to meet thee!,faust
Now am I wholly in thy might.But let me suckle first my baby!I blissed it all this livelong night;They took 't away to vex me maybeAnd now they say I killed the child outright.And never shall I be glad again.They sing songs about me! 'tis bad of the folk to do it!There's an old story has the same refrain;Who bade them so construe it?,faust
O let us kneel and call the Saints to hide us!Under the steps beside usThe threshold underHell heaves in thunder!The Evil OneWith terrible wrathSeeketh a pathHis prey to discover!,faust
Where is he? I heard him call me.I am free! No one shall enthrall me.To his neck will I flyOn his bosom lie!On the threshold he stood and _Margaret_! callingMidst of Hell's howling and noises appallingMidst of the wrathful infernal derisionI knew the sweet sound of the voice of the vision!,faust
'Tis he! 'tis he! Where now is all my pain?The anguish of the dungeon and the chain?'Tis thou! Thou comest to save meAnd I am saved!--Again the street I seeWhere first I looked on thee;And the garden brightly bloomingWhere I and Martha wait thy coming.,faust
Kiss me!--canst no longer do it?My friend so short a time thou'rt missingAnd hast unlearned thy kissing?Why is my heart so anxious on thy breast?Where once a heaven thy glances did create meA heaven thy loving words expressedAnd thou didst kiss as thou wouldst suffocate me--Kiss me!Or I'll kiss thee!,faust
Come follow me! My darling be more bold:I'll clasp thee soon with warmth a thousand-fold;But follow now! 'Tis all I beg of thee.,faust
Thou wilt unloose my chainAnd in thy lap wilt take me once again.How comes it that thou dost not shrink from me?--Say dost thou know my friend whom thou mak'st free?,faust
My mother have I put to death;I've drowned the baby born to thee.Was it not given to thee and me?Thee too!--'Tis thou! It scarcely true doth seem--Give me thy hand! 'Tis not a dream!Thy dear dear hand!--But ah 'tis wet!Why wipe it off! Methinks that yetThere's blood thereon.Ah God! what hast thou done?Nay sheathe thy sword at last!Do not affray me!,faust
No no! Thou must outlive us.Now I'll tell thee the graves to give us:Thou must begin to-morrowThe work of sorrow!The best place give to my motherThen close at her side my brotherAnd me a little awayBut not too very far I pray!And here on my right breast my baby lay!Nobody else will lie beside me!--Ah within thine arms to hide meThat was a sweet and a gracious blissBut no more no more can I attain it!I would force myself on thee and constrain itAnd it seems thou repellest my kiss:And yet 'tis thou so good so kind to see!,faust
  If the grave is thereDeath lying in wait then come!From here to eternal rest:No further step--no no!Thou goest away! O Henry if I could go!,faust
I dare not go: there's no hope any more.Why should I fly? They'll still my steps waylay!It is so wretched forced to beg my livingAnd a bad conscience sharper misery giving!It is so wretched to be strange forsakenAnd I'd still be followed and taken!,faust
Over the bridgeInto the woodTo the left where the plank is placedIn the pool!Seize it in haste!'Tis trying to rise'Tis struggling still!Save it! Save it!,faust
If the mountain we had only passed!There sits my mother upon a stone--I feel an icy shiver!There sits my mother upon a stoneAnd her head is wagging ever.She beckons she nods not her heavy head falls o'er;She slept so long that she wakes no more.She slept while we were caressing:Ah those were the days of blessing!,faust
No--let me go! I'll suffer no force!Grasp me not so murderously!I've done else all things for the love of thee.,faust
Day? Yes the day comes--the last day breaks for me!My wedding-day it was to be!Tell no one thou has been with Margaret!Woe for my garland! The chancesAre over--'tis all in vain!We shall meet once againBut not at the dances!The crowd is thronging no word is spoken:The square belowAnd the streets overflow:The death-bell tolls the wand is broken.I am seized and bound and delivered--Shoved to the block--they give the sign!Now over each neck has quiveredThe blade that is quivering over mine.Dumb lies the world like the grave!,faust
Off! or you're lost ere morn.Useless talking delaying and praying!My horses are neighing:The morning twilight is near.,faust
What rises up from the threshold here?He! he! suffer him not!What does he want in this holy spot?He seeks me!,faust
Thine am I Father! rescue me!Ye angels holy cohorts guard meCamp around and from evil ward me!Henry! I shudder to think of thee.,faust

To be content with what we at present know is for themost part to shut our ears against conviction; since from the verygradual character of our education we must continually forget andemancipate ourselves from knowledge previously acquired; we must setaside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and as we learn we must bedaily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour andanxiety to acquire.,ilias
It has been an easy and a popular expedient of late years to denythe personal or real existence of men and things whose life andcondition were too much for our belief. This system—which has oftencomforted the religious sceptic and substituted the consolations ofStrauss for those of the New Testament—has been of incalculable valueto the historical theorists of the last and present centuries. Toquestion the existence of Alexander the Great would be a moreexcusable act than to believe in that of Romulus. To deny a factrelated in Herodotus because it is inconsistent with a theorydeveloped from an Assyrian inscription which no two scholars read inthe same way is more pardonable than to believe in the good-naturedold king whom the elegant pen of Florian has idealized—_NumaPompilius._,ilias
Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homerand the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a freepermission to believe any theory provided we throw overboard allwritten tradition concerning the author or authors of the Iliad andOdyssey. What few authorities exist on the subject are summarilydismissed although the arguments appear to run in a circle. “Thiscannot be true because it is not true; and that is not true becauseit cannot be true.” Such seems to be the style in which testimony upontestimony statement upon statement is consigned to denial andoblivion.,ilias
It is however unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer arepartly forgeries partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination in whichtruth is the requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief review ofthe Homeric theory in its present conditions some notice must be takenof the treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed toHerodotus.,ilias
According to this document the city of Cumae in Æolia was at anearly period the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts ofGreece. Among the immigrants was Menapolus the son of Ithagenes.Although poor he married and the result of the union was a girl namedCritheis. The girl was left an orphan at an early age under theguardianship of Cleanax of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of thismaiden that we “are indebted for so much happiness.” Homer was thefirst fruit of her juvenile frailty and received the name ofMelesigenes from having been born near the river Meles in Boeotiawhither Critheis had been transported in order to save her reputation.,ilias
“At this time” continues our narrative “there lived at Smyrna a mannamed Phemius a teacher of literature and music who not beingmarried engaged Critheis to manage his household and spin the flax hereceived as the price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory washer performance of this task and so modest her conduct that he madeproposals of marriage declaring himself as a further inducementwilling to adopt her son who he asserted would become a clever manif he were carefully brought up.”,ilias
But poverty soon drove him to Cumae. Having passed over the Hermaeanplain he arrived at Neon Teichos the New Wall a colony of Cumae.Here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship ofone Tychias an armourer. “And up to my time” continued the author“the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving arecitation of his verses and they greatly honoured the spot. Here alsoa poplar grew which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenesarrived”.4,ilias
But poverty still drove him on and he went by way of Larissa as beingthe most convenient road. Here the Cumans say he composed an epitaphon Gordius king of Phrygia which has however and with greaterprobability been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus.5,ilias
Arrived at Cumae he frequented the _converzationes_6 of the old menand delighted all by the charms of his poetry. Encouraged by thisfavourable reception he declared that if they would allow him apublic maintenance he would render their city most gloriouslyrenowned. They avowed their willingness to support him in the measurehe proposed and procured him an audience in the council. Having madethe speech with the purport of which our author has forgotten toacquaint us he retired and left them to debate respecting the answerto be given to his proposal.,ilias
The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet’sdemand but one man observed that “if they were to feed _Homers_ theywould be encumbered with a multitude of useless people.” “From thiscircumstance” says the writer “Melesigenes acquired the name ofHomer for the Cumans call blind men _Homers._”7 With a love ofeconomy which shows how similar the world has always been in itstreatment of literary men the pension was denied and the poet ventedhis disappointment in a wish that Cumoea might never produce a poetcapable of giving it renown and glory.,ilias
At Phocoea Homer was destined to experience another literary distress.One Thestorides who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius keptHomer in his own house and allowed him a pittance on condition of theverses of the poet passing in his name. Having collected sufficientpoetry to be profitable Thestorides like some would-be-literarypublishers neglected the man whose brains he had sucked and left him.At his departure Homer is said to have observed: “O Thestorides ofthe many things hidden from the knowledge of man nothing is moreunintelligible than the human heart.”8,ilias
Homer continued his career of difficulty and distress until some Chianmerchants struck by the similarity of the verses they heard himrecite acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing aprofitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems. This atonce determined him to set out for Chios. No vessel happened then to besetting sail thither but he found one ready to start for Erythrae atown of Ionia which faces that island and he prevailed upon theseamen to allow him to accompany them. Having embarked he invoked afavourable wind and prayed that he might be able to expose theimposture of Thestorides who by his breach of hospitality had drawndown the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.,ilias
At Erythrae Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him inPhocoea by whose assistance he at length after some difficultyreached the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventurewhich we will continue in the words of our author. “Having set out fromPithys Homer went on attracted by the cries of some goats that werepasturing. The dogs barked on his approach and he cried out. Glaucus(for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice ran upquickly called off his dogs and drove them away from Homer. For sometime he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such aplace alone and what could be his design in coming. He then went up tohim and inquired who he was and how he had come to desolate placesand untrodden spots and of what he stood in need. Homer by recountingto him the whole history of his misfortunes moved him with compassion;and he took him and led him to his cot and having lit a fire badehim sup.9,ilias
“The dogs instead of eating kept barking at the stranger accordingto their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: OGlaucus my friend prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogstheir supper at the doors of the hut: for so it is better sincewhilst they watch nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold.,ilias
Glaucus was pleased with the advice and marvelled at its author.Having finished supper they banqueted10 afresh on conversation Homernarrating his wanderings and telling of the cities he had visited.,ilias
At length they retired to rest; but on the following morning Glaucusresolved to go to his master and acquaint him with his meeting withHomer. Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant he leftHomer at home promising to return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissusa place near the farm and finding his mate he told him the wholestory respecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention towhat he said and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in andfeeding maimed and enfeebled persons. However he bade him bring thestranger to him.,ilias
Glaucus told Homer what had taken place and bade him follow himassuring him that good fortune would be the result. Conversation soonshowed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and generalknowledge and the Chian persuaded him to remain and to undertake thecharge of his children.11,ilias
Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from theisland Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town ofChios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry.“To this day” says Chandler12 “the most curious remain is that whichhas been named without reason the School of Homer. It is on thecoast at some distance from the city northward and appears to havebeen an open temple of Cybele formed on the top of a rock. The shapeis oval and in the centre is the image of the goddess the head and anarm wanting. She is represented as usual sitting. The chair has alion carved on each side and on the back. The area is bounded by a lowrim or seat and about five yards over. The whole is hewn out of themountain is rude indistinct and probably of the most remoteantiquity.”,ilias
So successful was this school that Homer realised a considerablefortune. He married and had two daughters one of whom died singlethe other married a Chian.,ilias
The following passage betrays the same tendency to connect thepersonages of the poems with the history of the poet which has alreadybeen mentioned:—,ilias
“In his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towardsMentor of Ithaca in the Odyssey whose name he has inserted in hispoem as the companion of Ulysses13 in return for the care taken of himwhen afflicted with blindness. He also testifies his gratitude toPhemius who had given him both sustenance and instruction.”,ilias
His celebrity continued to increase and many persons advised him tovisit Greece whither his reputation had now extended. Having it issaid made some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanityof the Athenians of whose city he had hitherto made no mention14 hesent out for Samos. Here being recognized by a Samian who had met withhim in Chios he was handsomely received and invited to join incelebrating the Apaturian festival. He recited some verses which gavegreat satisfaction and by singing the Eiresione at the New Moonfestivals he earned a subsistence visiting the houses of the richwith whose children he was very popular.,ilias
In the spring he sailed for Athens and arrived at the island of Iosnow Ino where he fell extremely ill and died. It is said that hisdeath arose from vexation at not having been able to unravel an enigmaproposed by some fishermen’s children.15,ilias
Such is in brief the substance of the earliest life of Homer wepossess and so broad are the evidences of its historicalworthlessness that it is scarcely necessary to point them out indetail. Let us now consider some of the opinions to which apersevering patient and learned—but by no means consistent—series ofinvestigations has led. In doing so I profess to bring forwardstatements not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability.,ilias
“Homer appeared. The history of this poet and his works is lost indoubtful obscurity as is the history of many of the first minds whohave done honour to humanity because they rose amidst darkness. Themajestic stream of his song blessing and fertilizing flows like theNile through many lands and nations; and like the sources of theNile its fountains will ever remain concealed.”,ilias
Such are the words in which one of the most judicious German criticshas eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of theHomeric question is involved. With no less truth and feeling heproceeds:—,ilias
“It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature ofthings makes possible. If the period of tradition in history is theregion of twilight we should not expect in it perfect light. Thecreations of genius always seem like miracles because they are forthe most part created far out of the reach of observation. If we werein possession of all the historical testimonies we never could whollyexplain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin inall essential points must have remained the secret of the poet.” 16,ilias
From this criticism which shows as much insight into the depths ofhuman nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholasticinvestigation let us pass on to the main question at issue. Was Homeran individual?17 or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of aningenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets?,ilias
Well has Landor remarked: “Some tell us there were twenty Homers; somedeny that there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake thecontents of a vase in order to let them settle at last. We areperpetually labouring to destroy our delights our composure ourdevotion to superior power. Of all the animals on earth we least knowwhat is good for us. My opinion is that what is best for us is ouradmiration of good. No man living venerates Homer more than I do.” 18,ilias
But greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contentedwith the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured andfostered without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressionsby minute analysis—our editorial office compels us to give someattention to the doubts and difficulties with which the Homericquestion is beset and to entreat our reader for a brief period toprefer his judgment to his imagination and to condescend to drydetails.,ilias
Before however entering into particulars respecting the question ofthis unity of the Homeric poems (at least of the Iliad) I mustexpress my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the followingremarks:—,ilias
“We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by thebetter the poetic age of Greece almost conclusive testimony to itsoriginal composition. It was not till the age of the grammarians thatits primitive integrity was called in question; nor is it injustice toassert that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is notthe best qualification for the profound feeling the comprehensiveconception of an harmonious whole. The most exquisite anatomist may beno judge of the symmetry of the human frame: and we would take theopinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions and general beautyof a form rather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir Astley Cooper.,ilias
“‘The critic eye—that microscope of witSees hairs and pores examines bit by bitHow parts relate to parts or they to wholeThe body’s harmony the beaming soulAre things which Kuster Burmann Wasse shall seeWhen man’s whole frame is obvious to a flea.’”19Long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning the unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems. The grave and cautious Thucydides quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo20 the authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics. Longinus in an oft quoted passage merely expressed an opinion touching the comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the Iliad21 and among a mass of ancient authors whose very names22 it would be tedious to detail no suspicion of the personal non-existence of Homer ever arose. So far the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our early ideas on the subject; let us now see what are the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim.,ilias
At the end of the seventeenth century doubts had begun to awaken onthe subject and we find Bentley remarking that “Homer wrote a sequelof songs and rhapsodies to be sung by himself for small comings andgood cheer at festivals and other days of merriment. These loose songswere not collected together in the form of an epic poem till aboutPeisistratus’ time about five hundred years after.”23,ilias
Two French writers—Hedelin and Perrault—avowed a similar scepticism onthe subject; but it is in the “Scienza Nuova” of Battista Vico that wefirst meet with the germ of the theory subsequently defended by Wolfwith so much learning and acuteness. Indeed it is with the Wolfiantheory that we have chiefly to deal and with the following boldhypothesis which we will detail in the words of Grote24—,ilias
The loss of the digamma that _crux_ of critics that quicksand uponwhich even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked seems to prove beyonda doubt that the pronunciation of the Greek language had undergone aconsiderable change. Now it is certainly difficult to suppose that theHomeric poems could have suffered by this change had written copiesbeen preserved. If Chaucer’s poetry for instance had not beenwritten it could only have come down to us in a softened form morelike the effeminate version of Dryden than the rough quaint nobleoriginal.,ilias
But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession ofthe credit and we cannot help feeling the force of the followingobservations—,ilias
Grote although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on thesubject has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfiantheory and of Lachmann’s modifications with the character ofPeisistratus. But he has also shown and we think with equal successthat the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poemsor supposing that impossible the unison of these parts byPeisistratus and not before his time are essentially distinct. Inshort “a man may believe the Iliad to have been put together out ofpre-existing songs without recognising the age of Peisistratus as theperiod of its first compilation.” The friends or literary _employes_ ofPeisistratus must have found an Iliad that was already ancient and thesilence of the Alexandrine critics respecting the Peisistratic“recension” goes far to prove that among the numerous manuscriptsthey examined this was either wanting or thought unworthy ofattention.,ilias
On the whole I am inclined to believe that the labours ofPeisistratus were wholly of an editorial character although I mustconfess that I can lay down nothing respecting the extent of hislabours. At the same time so far from believing that the compositionor primary arrangement of these poems in their present form was thework of Peisistratus I am rather persuaded that the fine taste andelegant mind of that Athenian31 would lead him to preserve an ancientand traditional order of the poems rather than to patch andre-construct them according to a fanciful hypothesis. I will not repeatthe many discussions respecting whether the poems were written or notor whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputedauthor. Suffice it to say that the more we read the less satisfied weare upon either subject.,ilias
I cannot however help thinking that the story which attributes thepreservation of these poems to Lycurgus is little else than a versionof the same story as that of Peisistratus while its historicalprobability must be measured by that of many others relating to theSpartan Confucius.,ilias
I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories with an attemptmade by an ingenious friend to unite them into something likeconsistency. It is as follows:—,ilias
“No doubt the common soldiers of that age had like the common sailorsof some fifty years ago some one qualified to ‘discourse in excellentmusic’ among them. Many of these like those of the negroes in theUnited States were extemporaneous and allusive to events passingaround them. But what was passing around them? The grand events of aspirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves as themystical legends of former times had done upon their memory; besideswhich a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water andwas cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at firstand down to the beginning of the war with Troy were merelyrecitations with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitativeprobably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed as it aided thememory considerably.,ilias
“While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus he met with a balladrecording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon. His noble mind seizedthe hint that there presented itself and the Achilleis32 grew underhis hand. Unity of design however caused him to publish the poemunder the same pseudonyme as his former work: and the disjointed laysof the ancient bards were joined together like those relating to theCid into a chronicle history named the Iliad. Melesigenes knew thatthe poem was destined to be a lasting one and so it has proved; butfirst the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes andcorruptions by the people who took to singing them in the streetsassemblies and agoras. However Solon first and then Peisistratusand afterwards Aristoteles and others revised the poems and restoredthe works of Melesigenes Homeros to their original integrity in a greatmeasure.”33,ilias
But it is not on words only that grammarians mere grammarians willexercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity. Binding down anheroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previouslydissected his words and sentences they proceed to use the axe and thepruning knife by wholesale and inconsistent in everything but theirwish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation they cut out bookafter book passage after passage till the author is reduced to acollection of fragments or till those who fancied they possessed theworks of some great man find that they have been put off with a vilecounterfeit got up at second hand. If we compare the theories ofKnight Wolf Lachmann and others we shall feel better satisfied ofthe utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position ofHomer. One rejects what another considers the turning-point of histheory. One cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another wouldexplain by omitting something else.,ilias
While however I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has natureherself for its mainspring; while I can join with old Ennius inbelieving in Homer as the ghost who like some patron saint hoversround the bed of the poet and even bestows rare gifts from that wealthof imagination which a host of imitators could not exhaust—still I amfar from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found arich fund of tradition a well-stocked mythical storehouse from whencehe might derive both subject and embellishment. But it is one thing to_use_ existing romances in the embellishment of a poem another topatch up the poem itself from such materials. What consistency of styleand execution can be hoped for from such an attempt? or rather whatbad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result?,ilias
Sensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative and awareas I must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my beliefit still seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is reservedfor a higher criticism than it has often obtained. We are not by natureintended to know all things; still less to compass the powers by whichthe greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal. Werefaith no virtue then we might indeed wonder why God willed ourignorance on any matter. But we are too well taught the contrarylesson; and it seems as though our faith should be especially triedtouching the men and the events which have wrought most influence uponthe condition of humanity. And there is a kind of sacredness attachedto the memory of the great and the good which seems to bid us repulsethe scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasingapologue and measure the giants of intellect by an homeopathicdynameter.,ilias
Long and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our thoughtseven to his incongruities; or rather if we read in a right spirit andwith a heartfelt appreciation we are too much dazzled too deeplywrapped in admiration of the whole to dwell upon the minute spotswhich mere analysis can discover. In reading an heroic poem we musttransform ourselves into heroes of the time being we in imaginationmust fight over the same battles woo the same loves burn with thesame sense of injury as an Achilles or a Hector. And if we can butattain this degree of enthusiasm (and less enthusiasm will scarcelysuffice for the reading of Homer) we shall feel that the poems ofHomer are not only the work of one writer but of the greatest writerthat ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song.,ilias
And it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poemstheir powerful influence over the minds of the men of old. Heeren whois evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories finelyobserves:—,ilias
Can we contemplate that ancient monument on which the “Apotheosis ofHomer”36 is depictured and not feel how much of pleasing associationhow much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our mindsis lost by the admittance of any theory but our old tradition? The morewe read and the more we think—think as becomes the readers ofHomer—the more rooted becomes the conviction that the Father of Poetrygave us this rich inheritance whole and entire. Whatever were themeans of its preservation let us rather be thankful for the treasuryof taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use than seek to make ita mere centre around which to drive a series of theories whosewildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with each other.,ilias
As the hymns and some other poems usually ascribed to Homer are notincluded in Pope’s translation I will content myself with a briefaccount of the Battle of the Frogs and Mice from the pen of a writerwho has done it full justice37:—,ilias
Having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Pope’sdesign I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translationand on my own purpose in the present edition.,ilias
It would be absurd therefore to test Pope’s translation by our ownadvancing knowledge of the original text. We must be content to look atit as a most delightful work in itself—a work which is as much a partof English literature as Homer himself is of Greek. We must not be tornfrom our kindly associations with the old Iliad that once was our mostcherished companion or our most looked-for prize merely becauseButtmann Loewe and Liddell have made us so much more accurate as toamphikupellon being an adjective and not a substantive. Far be it fromus to defend the faults of Pope especially when we think of Chapman’sfine bold rough old English;—far be it from us to hold up histranslation as what a translation of Homer _might_ be. But we can stilldismiss Pope’s Iliad to the hands of our readers with theconsciousness that they must have read a very great number of booksbefore they have read its fellow.,ilias
Our author’s work is a wild paradise where if we cannot see all thebeauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden it is only because thenumber of them is infinitely greater. It is like a copious nurserywhich contains the seeds and first productions of every kind out ofwhich those who followed him have but selected some particular plantseach according to his fancy to cultivate and beautify. If some thingsare too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil; and ifothers are not arrived to perfection or maturity it is only becausethey are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature.,ilias
It is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attributethat unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in Homer that noman of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him.What he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable; every thingmoves every thing lives and is put in action. If a council be calledor a battle fought you are not coldly informed of what was said ordone as from a third person; the reader is hurried out of himself bythe force of the poet’s imagination and turns in one place to ahearer in another to a spectator. The course of his verses resemblesthat of the army he describes,ilias
I shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself ina manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituentparts of his work: as it is the great and peculiar characteristic whichdistinguishes him from all other authors.,ilias
This strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star which in theviolence of its course drew all things within its vortex. It seemednot enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts and the wholecompass of nature to supply his maxims and reflections; all the inwardpassions and affections of mankind to furnish his characters: and allthe outward forms and images of things for his descriptions: butwanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in he opened a new andboundless walk for his imagination and created a world for himself inthe invention of fable. That which Aristotle calls “the soul ofpoetry” was first breathed into it by Homer. I shall begin withconsidering him in his part as it is naturally the first; and I speakof it both as it means the design of a poem and as it is taken forfiction.,ilias
The marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural and especiallythe machines of the gods. If Homer was not the first who introduced thedeities (as Herodotus imagines) into the religion of Greece he seemsthe first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry andsuch a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity: for we findthose authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the godsconstantly laying their accusation against Homer as the chief supportof it. But whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in aphilosophical or religious view they are so perfect in the poeticthat mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: none havebeen able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set:every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful; and after all thevarious changes of times and religions his gods continue to this daythe gods of poetry.,ilias
If in the next place we take a view of the sentiments the samepresiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of histhoughts. Longinus has given his opinion that it was in this partHomer principally excelled. What were alone sufficient to prove thegrandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general is that theyhave so remarkable a parity with those of the Scripture. Duport in hisGnomologia Homerica has collected innumerable instances of this sort.And it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows that ifVirgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar he has not somany that are sublime and noble; and that the Roman author seldom risesinto very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the Iliad.,ilias
To throw his language more out of prose Homer seems to have affectedthe compound epithets. This was a sort of composition peculiarly properto poetry not only as it heightened the diction but as it assistedand filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp and likewiseconduced in some measure to thicken the images. On this lastconsideration I cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness ofhis invention since (as he has managed them) they are a sort ofsupernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they werejoined. We see the motion of Hector’s plumes in the epithetKorythaiolos the landscape of Mount Neritus in that of Einosiphyllosand so of others which particular images could not have been insistedupon so long as to express them in a description (though but of asingle line) without diverting the reader too much from the principalaction or figure. As a metaphor is a short simile one of theseepithets is a short description.,ilias
But after all it is with great parts as with great virtues theynaturally border on some imperfection; and it is often hard todistinguish exactly where the virtue ends or the fault begins. Asprudence may sometimes sink to suspicion so may a great judgmentdecline to coldness; and as magnanimity may run up to profusion orextravagance so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness. If welook upon Homer in this view we shall perceive the chief objectionsagainst him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of thisfaculty.,ilias
Among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions upon whichso much criticism has been spent as surpassing all the bounds ofprobability. Perhaps it may be with great and superior souls as withgigantic bodies which exerting themselves with unusual strengthexceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts to becomemiracles in the whole; and like the old heroes of that make commitsomething near extravagance amidst a series of glorious and inimitableperformances. Thus Homer has his “speaking horses;” and Virgil his“myrtles distilling blood;” where the latter has not so much ascontrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability.,ilias
It is owing to the same vast invention that his similes have beenthought too exuberant and full of circumstances. The force of thisfaculty is seen in nothing more than in its inability to confineitself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison isgrounded: it runs out into embellishments of additional images whichhowever are so managed as not to overpower the main one. His similesare like pictures where the principal figure has not only itsproportion given agreeable to the original but is also set off withoccasional ornaments and prospects. The same will account for hismanner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath whenhis fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondentimages. The reader will easily extend this observation to moreobjections of the same kind.,ilias
Having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original itremains to treat of the translation with the same view to the chiefcharacteristic. As far as that is seen in the main parts of the poemsuch as the fable manners and sentiments no translator can prejudiceit but by wilful omissions or contractions. As it also breaks out inevery particular image description and simile whoever lessens or toomuch softens those takes off from this chief character. It is thefirst grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire andunmaimed; and for the rest the diction and versification only are hisproper province since these must be his own but the others he is totake as he finds them.,ilias
This pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in theScripture and our author. One may affirm with all respect to theinspired writings that the Divine Spirit made use of no other wordsbut what were intelligible and common to men at that time and in thatpart of the world; and as Homer is the author nearest to those hisstyle must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred booksthan that of any other writer. This consideration (together with whathas been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts) may methinksinduce a translator on the one hand to give in to several of thosegeneral phrases and manners of expression which have attained aveneration even in our language from being used in the Old Testament;as on the other to avoid those which have been appropriated to theDivinity and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion.,ilias
For a further preservation of this air of simplicity a particular careshould be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences andproverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet. They havesomething venerable and as I may say oracular in that unadornedgravity and shortness with which they are delivered: a grace whichwould be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a moreingenious (that is a more modern) turn in the paraphrase.,ilias
Perhaps the mixture of some Graecisms and old words after the manner ofMilton if done without too much affectation might not have an illeffect in a version of this particular work which most of any otherseems to require a venerable antique cast. But certainly the use ofmodern terms of war and government such as “platoon campaign junto”or the like (into which some of his translators have fallen) cannot beallowable; those only excepted without which it is impossible to treatthe subjects in any living language.,ilias
There are two peculiarities in Homer’s diction which are a sort ofmarks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at firstsight; those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them asdefects and those who are seemed pleased with them as beauties. Ispeak of his compound epithets and of his repetitions. Many of theformer cannot be done literally into English without destroying thepurity of our language. I believe such should be retained as slideeasily of themselves into an English compound without violence to theear or to the received rules of composition as well as those whichhave received a sanction from the authority of our best poets and arebecome familiar through their use of them; such as “thecloud-compelling Jove” &c. As for the rest whenever any can be asfully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compoundedone the course to be taken is obvious.,ilias
As for Homer’s repetitions we may divide them into three sorts: ofwhole narrations and speeches of single sentences and of one verse orhemistitch. I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to theseas neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand norto offend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is notungraceful in those speeches where the dignity of the speaker rendersit a sort of insolence to alter his words; as in the messages from godsto men or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state orwhere the ceremonial of religion seems to require it in the solemnforms of prayers oaths or the like. In other cases I believe thebest rule is to be guided by the nearness or distance at which therepetitions are placed in the original: when they follow too close onemay vary the expression; but it is a question whether a professedtranslator be authorized to omit any: if they be tedious the author isto answer for it.,ilias
It only remains to speak of the versification. Homer (as has been said)is perpetually applying the sound to the sense and varying it on everynew subject. This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties ofpoetry and attainable by very few: I only know of Homer eminent for itin the Greek and Virgil in the Latin. I am sensible it is what maysometimes happen by chance when a writer is warm and fully possessedof his image: however it may reasonably be believed they designedthis in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree toall others. Few readers have the ear to be judges of it: but those whohave will see I have endeavoured at this beauty.,ilias
Hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general; butfor particulars and circumstances he continually lops them and oftenomits the most beautiful. As for its being esteemed a closetranslation I doubt not many have been led into that error by theshortness of it which proceeds not from his following the originalline by line but from the contractions above mentioned. He sometimesomits whole similes and sentences; and is now and then guilty ofmistakes into which no writer of his learning could have fallen butthrough carelessness. His poetry as well as Ogilby’s is too mean forcriticism.,ilias
It is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did not liveto translate the Iliad. He has left us only the first book and a smallpart of the sixth; in which if he has in some places not trulyinterpreted the sense or preserved the antiquities it ought to beexcused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in. He seems tohave had too much regard to Chapman whose words he sometimes copiesand has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from theoriginal. However had he translated the whole work I would no morehave attempted Homer after him than Virgil: his version of whom(notwithstanding some human errors) is the most noble and spiritedtranslation I know in any language. But the fate of great geniuses islike that of great ministers: though they are confessedly the first inthe commonwealth of letters they must be envied and calumniated onlyfor being at the head of it.,ilias
“Read Homer once and you can read no more;For all books else appear so mean so poorVerse will seem prose: but still persist to readAnd Homer will be all the books you need.”That the Earl of Halifax was one of the first to favour me; of whom it is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing to his generosity or his example: that such a genius as my Lord Bolingbroke not more distinguished in the great scenes of business than in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning has not refused to be the critic of these sheets and the patron of their writer: and that the noble author of the tragedy of “Heroic Love” has continued his partiality to me from my writing pastorals to my attempting the Iliad. I cannot deny myself the pride of confessing that I have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct in general but their correction of several particulars of this translation.,ilias
I could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by theEarl of Carnarvon; but it is almost absurd to particularize any onegenerous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series ofthem. Mr. Stanhope the present secretary of state will pardon mydesire of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair.The particular zeal of Mr. Harcourt (the son of the late LordChancellor) gave me a proof how much I am honoured in a share of hisfriendship. I must attribute to the same motive that of several othersof my friends: to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary bythe privileges of a familiar correspondence; and I am satisfied I canno way better oblige men of their turn than by my silence.,ilias
In short I have found more patrons than ever Homer wanted. He wouldhave thought himself happy to have met the same favour at Athens thathas been shown me by its learned rival the University of Oxford. And Ican hardly envy him those pompous honours he received after death whenI reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations and easyfriendships which make the satisfaction of life. This distinction isthe more to be acknowledged as it is shown to one whose pen has nevergratified the prejudices of particular parties or the vanities ofparticular men. Whatever the success may prove I shall never repent ofan undertaking in which I have experienced the candour and friendshipof so many persons of merit; and in which I hope to pass some of thoseyears of youth that are generally lost in a circle of follies after amanner neither wholly unuseful to others nor disagreeable to myself.,ilias
The time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book: nine duringthe plague one in the council and quarrel of the princes and twelvefor Jupiter’s stay with the Æthiopians at whose return Thetis prefersher petition. The scene lies in the Grecian camp then changes toChrysa and lastly to Olympus.,ilias
Achilles’ wrath to Greece the direful springOf woes unnumber’d heavenly goddess sing!That wrath which hurl’d to Pluto’s gloomy reignThe souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain;Whose limbs unburied on the naked shoreDevouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.41Since great Achilles and Atrides stroveSuch was the sovereign doom and such the will of Jove!42,ilias
Declare O Muse! in what ill-fated hour43Sprung the fierce strife from what offended powerLatona’s son a dire contagion spread44And heap’d the camp with mountains of the dead;The king of men his reverent priest defied45And for the king’s offence the people died.,ilias
For Chryses sought with costly gifts to gainHis captive daughter from the victor’s chain.Suppliant the venerable father stands;Apollo’s awful ensigns grace his hands:By these he begs; and lowly bending downExtends the sceptre and the laurel crown.He sued to all but chief implored for graceThe brother-kings of Atreus’ royal race46,ilias
“Ye kings and warriors! may your vows be crown’dAnd Troy’s proud walls lie level with the ground.May Jove restore you when your toils are o’erSafe to the pleasures of your native shore.But oh! relieve a wretched parent’s painAnd give Chryseis to these arms again;If mercy fail yet let my presents moveAnd dread avenging Phoebus son of Jove.”,ilias
The Greeks in shouts their joint assent declareThe priest to reverence and release the fair.Not so Atrides; he with kingly prideRepulsed the sacred sire and thus replied:“Hence on thy life and fly these hostile plainsNor ask presumptuous what the king detains:,ilias
Hence with thy laurel crown and golden rodNor trust too far those ensigns of thy god.Mine is thy daughter priest and shall remain;And prayers and tears and bribes shall plead in vain;Till time shall rifle every youthful graceAnd age dismiss her from my cold embraceIn daily labours of the loom employ’dOr doom’d to deck the bed she once enjoy’d.Hence then; to Argos shall the maid retireFar from her native soil and weeping sire.”,ilias
The trembling priest along the shore return’dAnd in the anguish of a father mourn’d.Disconsolate not daring to complainSilent he wander’d by the sounding main;Till safe at distance to his god he praysThe god who darts around the world his rays.,ilias
“O Smintheus! sprung from fair Latona’s line47Thou guardian power of Cilla the divine48Thou source of light! whom Tenedos adoresAnd whose bright presence gilds thy Chrysa’s shores.If e’er with wreaths I hung thy sacred fane49Or fed the flames with fat of oxen slain;God of the silver bow! thy shafts employAvenge thy servant and the Greeks destroy.”,ilias
Thus Chryses pray’d.—the favouring power attendsAnd from Olympus’ lofty tops descends.Bent was his bow the Grecian hearts to wound;50Fierce as he moved his silver shafts resound.Breathing revenge a sudden night he spreadAnd gloomy darkness roll’d about his head.The fleet in view he twang’d his deadly bowAnd hissing fly the feather’d fates below.On mules and dogs the infection first began;51And last the vengeful arrows fix’d in man.For nine long nights through all the dusky airThe pyres thick-flaming shot a dismal glare.But ere the tenth revolving day was runInspired by Juno Thetis’ godlike sonConvened to council all the Grecian train;For much the goddess mourn’d her heroes slain.52The assembly seated rising o’er the restAchilles thus the king of men address’d:,ilias
“Why leave we not the fatal Trojan shoreAnd measure back the seas we cross’d before?The plague destroying whom the sword would spare’Tis time to save the few remains of war.But let some prophet or some sacred sageExplore the cause of great Apollo’s rage;Or learn the wasteful vengeance to removeBy mystic dreams for dreams descend from Jove.53If broken vows this heavy curse have laidLet altars smoke and hecatombs be paid.So Heaven atoned shall dying Greece restoreAnd Phoebus dart his burning shafts no more.”,ilias
He said and sat: when Chalcas thus replied;Chalcas the wise the Grecian priest and guideThat sacred seer whose comprehensive viewThe past the present and the future knew:Uprising slow the venerable sageThus spoke the prudence and the fears of age:,ilias
“Beloved of Jove Achilles! would’st thou knowWhy angry Phoebus bends his fatal bow?First give thy faith and plight a prince’s wordOf sure protection by thy power and sword:For I must speak what wisdom would concealAnd truths invidious to the great revealBold is the task when subjects grown too wiseInstruct a monarch where his error lies;For though we deem the short-lived fury past’Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last.”To whom Pelides:—“From thy inmost soulSpeak what thou know’st and speak without control.E’en by that god I swear who rules the dayTo whom thy hands the vows of Greece convey.And whose bless’d oracles thy lips declare;Long as Achilles breathes this vital airNo daring Greek of all the numerous bandAgainst his priest shall lift an impious hand;Not e’en the chief by whom our hosts are ledThe king of kings shall touch that sacred head.”,ilias
Encouraged thus the blameless man replies:“Nor vows unpaid nor slighted sacrificeBut he our chief provoked the raging pestApollo’s vengeance for his injured priest.Nor will the god’s awaken’d fury ceaseBut plagues shall spread and funeral fires increaseTill the great king without a ransom paidTo her own Chrysa send the black-eyed maid.54Perhaps with added sacrifice and prayerThe priest may pardon and the god may spare.”,ilias
The spoils of cities razed and warriors slainWe share with justice as with toil we gain;But to resume whate’er thy avarice craves(That trick of tyrants) may be borne by slaves.Yet if our chief for plunder only fightThe spoils of Ilion shall thy loss requiteWhene’er by Jove’s decree our conquering powersShall humble to the dust her lofty towers.”,ilias
Achilles heard with grief and rage oppress’dHis heart swell’d high and labour’d in his breast;Distracting thoughts by turns his bosom ruled;Now fired by wrath and now by reason cool’d:That prompts his hand to draw the deadly swordForce through the Greeks and pierce their haughty lord;This whispers soft his vengeance to controlAnd calm the rising tempest of his soul.Just as in anguish of suspense he stay’dWhile half unsheathed appear’d the glittering blade57Minerva swift descended from aboveSent by the sister and the wife of Jove(For both the princes claim’d her equal care);Behind she stood and by the golden hairAchilles seized; to him alone confess’d;A sable cloud conceal’d her from the rest.He sees and sudden to the goddess criesKnown by the flames that sparkle from her eyes:,ilias
“Descends Minerva in her guardian careA heavenly witness of the wrongs I bearFrom Atreus’ son?—Then let those eyes that viewThe daring crime behold the vengeance too.”,ilias
“Forbear (the progeny of Jove replies)To calm thy fury I forsake the skies:Let great Achilles to the gods resign’dTo reason yield the empire o’er his mind.By awful Juno this command is given;The king and you are both the care of heaven.The force of keen reproaches let him feel;But sheathe obedient thy revenging steel.For I pronounce (and trust a heavenly power)Thy injured honour has its fated hourWhen the proud monarch shall thy arms imploreAnd bribe thy friendship with a boundless store.Then let revenge no longer bear the sway;Command thy passions and the gods obey.”,ilias
To her Pelides:—“With regardful ear’Tis just O goddess! I thy dictates hear.Hard as it is my vengeance I suppress:Those who revere the gods the gods will bless.”He said observant of the blue-eyed maid;Then in the sheath return’d the shining blade.The goddess swift to high Olympus fliesAnd joins the sacred senate of the skies.,ilias
He spoke; and furious hurl’d against the groundHis sceptre starr’d with golden studs around:Then sternly silent sat. With like disdainThe raging king return’d his frowns again.,ilias
To calm their passion with the words of ageSlow from his seat arose the Pylian sageExperienced Nestor in persuasion skill’d;Words sweet as honey from his lips distill’d:58Two generations now had pass’d awayWise by his rules and happy by his sway;Two ages o’er his native realm he reign’dAnd now the example of the third remain’d.All view’d with awe the venerable man;Who thus with mild benevolence began:—,ilias
This said he ceased. The king of men replies:“Thy years are awful and thy words are wise.But that imperious that unconquer’d soulNo laws can limit no respect control.Before his pride must his superiors fall;His word the law and he the lord of all?Him must our hosts our chiefs ourself obey?What king can bear a rival in his sway?Grant that the gods his matchless force have given;Has foul reproach a privilege from heaven?”,ilias
Here on the monarch’s speech Achilles brokeAnd furious thus and interrupting spoke:“Tyrant I well deserved thy galling chainTo live thy slave and still to serve in vainShould I submit to each unjust decree:—Command thy vassals but command not me.Seize on Briseis whom the Grecians doom’dMy prize of war yet tamely see resumed;And seize secure; no more Achilles drawsHis conquering sword in any woman’s cause.The gods command me to forgive the past:But let this first invasion be the last:For know thy blood when next thou darest invadeShall stream in vengeance on my reeking blade.”,ilias
Achilles with Patroclus took his wayWhere near his tents his hollow vessels lay.Meantime Atrides launch’d with numerous oarsA well-rigg’d ship for Chrysa’s sacred shores:High on the deck was fair Chryseis placedAnd sage Ulysses with the conduct graced:Safe in her sides the hecatomb they stow’dThen swiftly sailing cut the liquid road.,ilias
The host to expiate next the king preparesWith pure lustrations and with solemn prayers.Wash’d by the briny wave the pious train59Are cleansed; and cast the ablutions in the main.Along the shore whole hecatombs were laidAnd bulls and goats to Phoebus’ altars paid;The sable fumes in curling spires ariseAnd waft their grateful odours to the skies.,ilias
The army thus in sacred rites engagedAtrides still with deep resentment raged.To wait his will two sacred heralds stoodTalthybius and Eurybates the good.“Haste to the fierce Achilles’ tent (he cries)Thence bear Briseis as our royal prize:Submit he must; or if they will not partOurself in arms shall tear her from his heart.”,ilias
The unwilling heralds act their lord’s commands;Pensive they walk along the barren sands:Arrived the hero in his tent they findWith gloomy aspect on his arm reclined.At awful distance long they silent standLoth to advance and speak their hard command;Decent confusion! This the godlike manPerceived and thus with accent mild began:,ilias
“With leave and honour enter our abodesYe sacred ministers of men and gods!60I know your message; by constraint you came;Not you but your imperious lord I blame.Patroclus haste the fair Briseis bring;Conduct my captive to the haughty king.But witness heralds and proclaim my vowWitness to gods above and men below!But first and loudest to your prince declare(That lawless tyrant whose commands you bear)Unmoved as death Achilles shall remainThough prostrate Greece shall bleed at every vein:The raging chief in frantic passion lostBlind to himself and useless to his hostUnskill’d to judge the future by the pastIn blood and slaughter shall repent at last.”,ilias
Patroclus now the unwilling beauty brought;She in soft sorrows and in pensive thoughtPass’d silent as the heralds held her handAnd oft look’d back slow-moving o’er the strand.Not so his loss the fierce Achilles bore;But sad retiring to the sounding shoreO’er the wild margin of the deep he hungThat kindred deep from whence his mother sprung:61There bathed in tears of anger and disdainThus loud lamented to the stormy main:,ilias
“O parent goddess! since in early bloomThy son must fall by too severe a doom;Sure to so short a race of glory bornGreat Jove in justice should this span adorn:Honour and fame at least the thunderer owed;And ill he pays the promise of a godIf yon proud monarch thus thy son defiesObscures my glories and resumes my prize.”,ilias
Far from the deep recesses of the mainWhere aged Ocean holds his watery reignThe goddess-mother heard. The waves divide;And like a mist she rose above the tide;Beheld him mourning on the naked shoresAnd thus the sorrows of his soul explores.“Why grieves my son? Thy anguish let me share;Reveal the cause and trust a parent’s care.”,ilias
“Unhappy son! (fair Thetis thus repliesWhile tears celestial trickle from her eyes)Why have I borne thee with a mother’s throesTo Fates averse and nursed for future woes?65So short a space the light of heaven to view!So short a space! and fill’d with sorrow too!O might a parent’s careful wish prevailFar far from Ilion should thy vessels sailAnd thou from camps remote the danger shunWhich now alas! too nearly threats my son.Yet (what I can) to move thy suit I’ll goTo great Olympus crown’d with fleecy snow.Meantime secure within thy ships from farBehold the field not mingle in the war.The sire of gods and all the ethereal trainOn the warm limits of the farthest mainNow mix with mortals nor disdain to graceThe feasts of Æthiopia’s blameless race66Twelve days the powers indulge the genial riteReturning with the twelfth revolving light.Then will I mount the brazen dome and moveThe high tribunal of immortal Jove.”,ilias
The goddess spoke: the rolling waves unclose;Then down the steep she plunged from whence she roseAnd left him sorrowing on the lonely coastIn wild resentment for the fair he lost.,ilias
In Chrysa’s port now sage Ulysses rode;Beneath the deck the destined victims stow’d:The sails they furl’d they lash the mast asideAnd dropp’d their anchors and the pinnace tied.Next on the shore their hecatomb they land;Chryseis last descending on the strand.Her thus returning from the furrow’d mainUlysses led to Phoebus’ sacred fane;Where at his solemn altar as the maidHe gave to Chryses thus the hero said:,ilias
“Hail reverend priest! to Phoebus’ awful domeA suppliant I from great Atrides come:Unransom’d here receive the spotless fair;Accept the hecatomb the Greeks prepare;And may thy god who scatters darts aroundAtoned by sacrifice desist to wound.”67,ilias
At this the sire embraced the maid againSo sadly lost so lately sought in vain.Then near the altar of the darting kingDisposed in rank their hecatomb they bring;With water purify their hands and takeThe sacred offering of the salted cake;While thus with arms devoutly raised in airAnd solemn voice the priest directs his prayer:,ilias
“God of the silver bow thy ear inclineWhose power incircles Cilla the divine;Whose sacred eye thy Tenedos surveysAnd gilds fair Chrysa with distinguish’d rays!If fired to vengeance at thy priest’s requestThy direful darts inflict the raging pest:Once more attend! avert the wasteful woeAnd smile propitious and unbend thy bow.”,ilias
’Twas night; the chiefs beside their vessel lieTill rosy morn had purpled o’er the sky:Then launch and hoist the mast: indulgent galesSupplied by Phoebus fill the swelling sails;The milk-white canvas bellying as they blowThe parted ocean foams and roars below:Above the bounding billows swift they flewTill now the Grecian camp appear’d in view.Far on the beach they haul their bark to land(The crooked keel divides the yellow sand)Then part where stretch’d along the winding bayThe ships and tents in mingled prospect lay.,ilias
But raging still amidst his navy satThe stern Achilles stedfast in his hate;Nor mix’d in combat nor in council join’d;But wasting cares lay heavy on his mind:In his black thoughts revenge and slaughter rollAnd scenes of blood rise dreadful in his soul.,ilias
Twelve days were past and now the dawning lightThe gods had summon’d to the Olympian height:Jove first ascending from the watery bowersLeads the long order of ethereal powers.When like the morning-mist in early dayRose from the flood the daughter of the sea:And to the seats divine her flight address’d.There far apart and high above the restThe thunderer sat; where old Olympus shroudsHis hundred heads in heaven and props the clouds.Suppliant the goddess stood: one hand she placedBeneath his beard and one his knees embraced.“If e’er O father of the gods! (she said)My words could please thee or my actions aidSome marks of honour on my son bestowAnd pay in glory what in life you owe.Fame is at least by heavenly promise dueTo life so short and now dishonour’d too.Avenge this wrong O ever just and wise!Let Greece be humbled and the Trojans rise;Till the proud king and all the Achaian raceShall heap with honours him they now disgrace.”,ilias
Thus Thetis spoke; but Jove in silence heldThe sacred counsels of his breast conceal’d.Not so repulsed the goddess closer press’dStill grasp’d his knees and urged the dear request.“O sire of gods and men! thy suppliant hear;Refuse or grant; for what has Jove to fear?Or oh! declare of all the powers aboveIs wretched Thetis least the care of Jove?”,ilias
“What hast thou ask’d? ah why should Jove engageIn foreign contests and domestic rageThe gods’ complaints and Juno’s fierce alarmsWhile I too partial aid the Trojan arms?Go lest the haughty partner of my swayWith jealous eyes thy close access survey;But part in peace secure thy prayer is sped:Witness the sacred honours of our headThe nod that ratifies the will divineThe faithful fix’d irrevocable sign;This seals thy suit and this fulfils thy vows—”He spoke and awful bends his sable brows70Shakes his ambrosial curls and gives the nodThe stamp of fate and sanction of the god:High heaven with trembling the dread signal tookAnd all Olympus to the centre shook.71,ilias
Swift to the seas profound the goddess fliesJove to his starry mansions in the skies.The shining synod of the immortals waitThe coming god and from their thrones of stateArising silent wrapp’d in holy fearBefore the majesty of heaven appear.Trembling they stand while Jove assumes the throneAll but the god’s imperious queen alone:Late had she view’d the silver-footed dameAnd all her passions kindled into flame.“Say artful manager of heaven (she cries)Who now partakes the secrets of the skies?Thy Juno knows not the decrees of fateIn vain the partner of imperial state.What favourite goddess then those cares dividesWhich Jove in prudence from his consort hides?”,ilias
To this the thunderer: “Seek not thou to findThe sacred counsels of almighty mind:Involved in darkness lies the great decreeNor can the depths of fate be pierced by thee.What fits thy knowledge thou the first shalt know;The first of gods above and men below;But thou nor they shall search the thoughts that rollDeep in the close recesses of my soul.”,ilias
Full on the sire the goddess of the skiesRoll’d the large orbs of her majestic eyesAnd thus return’d:—“Austere Saturnius sayFrom whence this wrath or who controls thy sway?Thy boundless will for me remains in forceAnd all thy counsels take the destined course.But ’tis for Greece I fear: for late was seenIn close consult the silver-footed queen.Jove to his Thetis nothing could denyNor was the signal vain that shook the sky.What fatal favour has the goddess wonTo grace her fierce inexorable son?Perhaps in Grecian blood to drench the plainAnd glut his vengeance with my people slain.”,ilias
Then thus the god: “O restless fate of prideThat strives to learn what heaven resolves to hide;Vain is the search presumptuous and abhorr’dAnxious to thee and odious to thy lord.Let this suffice: the immutable decreeNo force can shake: what is that ought to be.Goddess submit; nor dare our will withstandBut dread the power of this avenging hand:The united strength of all the gods aboveIn vain resists the omnipotence of Jove.”,ilias
The thunderer spoke nor durst the queen reply;A reverent horror silenced all the sky.The feast disturb’d with sorrow Vulcan sawHis mother menaced and the gods in awe;Peace at his heart and pleasure his designThus interposed the architect divine:“The wretched quarrels of the mortal stateAre far unworthy gods! of your debate:Let men their days in senseless strife employWe in eternal peace and constant joy.Thou goddess-mother with our sire complyNor break the sacred union of the sky:Lest roused to rage he shake the bless’d abodesLaunch the red lightning and dethrone the gods.If you submit the thunderer stands appeased;The gracious power is willing to be pleased.”,ilias
Thus Vulcan spoke: and rising with a boundThe double bowl with sparkling nectar crown’d72Which held to Juno in a cheerful way“Goddess (he cried) be patient and obey.Dear as you are if Jove his arm extendI can but grieve unable to defend.What god so daring in your aid to moveOr lift his hand against the force of Jove?Once in your cause I felt his matchless mightHurl’d headlong down from the ethereal height;73Toss’d all the day in rapid circles roundNor till the sun descended touch’d the ground.Breathless I fell in giddy motion lost;The Sinthians raised me on the Lemnian coast;74,ilias
He said and to her hands the goblet heavedWhich with a smile the white-arm’d queen receivedThen to the rest he fill’d; and in his turnEach to his lips applied the nectar’d urnVulcan with awkward grace his office pliesAnd unextinguish’d laughter shakes the skies.,ilias
Thus the blest gods the genial day prolongIn feasts ambrosial and celestial song.75Apollo tuned the lyre; the Muses roundWith voice alternate aid the silver sound.Meantime the radiant sun to mortal sightDescending swift roll’d down the rapid light:Then to their starry domes the gods departThe shining monuments of Vulcan’s art:Jove on his couch reclined his awful headAnd Juno slumber’d on the golden bed.,ilias
The time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day. Thescene lies in the Grecian camp and upon the sea-shore; towards the endit removes to Troy.,ilias
Now pleasing sleep had seal’d each mortal eyeStretch’d in the tents the Grecian leaders lie:The immortals slumber’d on their thrones above;All but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.76To honour Thetis’ son he bends his careAnd plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war:Then bids an empty phantom rise to sightAnd thus commands the vision of the night.,ilias
“Fly hence deluding Dream! and light as air77To Agamemnon’s ample tent repair.Bid him in arms draw forth the embattled trainLead all his Grecians to the dusty plain.Declare e’en now ’tis given him to destroyThe lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.For now no more the gods with fate contendAt Juno’s suit the heavenly factions end.Destruction hangs o’er yon devoted wallAnd nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.”,ilias
Swift as the word the vain illusion fledDescends and hovers o’er Atrides’ head;Clothed in the figure of the Pylian sageRenown’d for wisdom and revered for age:Around his temples spreads his golden wingAnd thus the flattering dream deceives the king.,ilias
“Canst thou with all a monarch’s cares oppress’dO Atreus’ son! canst thou indulge thy rest?78Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guidesDirects in council and in war presidesTo whom its safety a whole people owesTo waste long nights in indolent repose.79Monarch awake! ’tis Jove’s command I bear;Thou and thy glory claim his heavenly care.In just array draw forth the embattled trainLead all thy Grecians to the dusty plain;E’en now O king! ’tis given thee to destroyThe lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.For now no more the gods with fate contendAt Juno’s suit the heavenly factions end.Destruction hangs o’er yon devoted wallAnd nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.Awake but waking this advice approveAnd trust the vision that descends from Jove.”,ilias
The phantom said; then vanish’d from his sightResolves to air and mixes with the night.A thousand schemes the monarch’s mind employ;Elate in thought he sacks untaken Troy:Vain as he was and to the future blindNor saw what Jove and secret fate design’dWhat mighty toils to either host remainWhat scenes of grief and numbers of the slain!Eager he rises and in fancy hearsThe voice celestial murmuring in his ears.First on his limbs a slender vest he drewAround him next the regal mantle threwThe embroider’d sandals on his feet were tied;The starry falchion glitter’d at his side;And last his arm the massy sceptre loadsUnstain’d immortal and the gift of gods.,ilias
Now rosy Morn ascends the court of JoveLifts up her light and opens day above.The king despatch’d his heralds with commandsTo range the camp and summon all the bands:The gathering hosts the monarch’s word obey;While to the fleet Atrides bends his way.In his black ship the Pylian prince he found;There calls a senate of the peers around:The assembly placed the king of men express’dThe counsels labouring in his artful breast.,ilias
“Friends and confederates! with attentive earReceive my words and credit what you hear.Late as I slumber’d in the shades of nightA dream divine appear’d before my sight;Whose visionary form like Nestor cameThe same in habit and in mien the same.80The heavenly phantom hover’d o’er my head‘And dost thou sleep O Atreus’ son? (he said)Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guidesDirects in council and in war presides;To whom its safety a whole people owesTo waste long nights in indolent repose.Monarch awake! ’tis Jove’s command I bearThou and thy glory claim his heavenly care.In just array draw forth the embattled trainAnd lead the Grecians to the dusty plain;E’en now O king! ’tis given thee to destroyThe lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.For now no more the gods with fate contendAt Juno’s suit the heavenly factions end.Destruction hangs o’er yon devoted wallAnd nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.,ilias
This hear observant and the gods obey!’The vision spoke and pass’d in air away.Now valiant chiefs! since heaven itself alarmsUnite and rouse the sons of Greece to arms.But first with caution try what yet they dareWorn with nine years of unsuccessful war.To move the troops to measure back the mainBe mine; and yours the province to detain.”,ilias
He spoke and sat: when Nestor rising said(Nestor whom Pylos’ sandy realms obey’d)“Princes of Greece your faithful ears inclineNor doubt the vision of the powers divine;Sent by great Jove to him who rules the hostForbid it heaven! this warning should be lost!Then let us haste obey the god’s alarmsAnd join to rouse the sons of Greece to arms.”,ilias
His deep design unknown the hosts approveAtrides’ speech. The mighty numbers move.So roll the billows to the Icarian shoreFrom east and south when winds begin to roarBurst their dark mansions in the clouds and sweepThe whitening surface of the ruffled deep.And as on corn when western gusts descend85Before the blast the lofty harvests bend:Thus o’er the field the moving host appearsWith nodding plumes and groves of waving spears.The gathering murmur spreads their trampling feetBeat the loose sands and thicken to the fleet;With long-resounding cries they urge the trainTo fit the ships and launch into the main.They toil they sweat thick clouds of dust ariseThe doubling clamours echo to the skies.E’en then the Greeks had left the hostile plainAnd fate decreed the fall of Troy in vain;But Jove’s imperial queen their flight survey’dAnd sighing thus bespoke the blue-eyed maid:,ilias
“Shall then the Grecians fly! O dire disgrace!And leave unpunish’d this perfidious race?Shall Troy shall Priam and the adulterous spouseIn peace enjoy the fruits of broken vows?And bravest chiefs in Helen’s quarrel slainLie unrevenged on yon detested plain?No: let my Greeks unmoved by vain alarmsOnce more refulgent shine in brazen arms.Haste goddess haste! the flying host detainNor let one sail be hoisted on the main.”,ilias
Pallas obeys and from Olympus’ heightSwift to the ships precipitates her flight.Ulysses first in public cares she foundFor prudent counsel like the gods renown’d:Oppress’d with generous grief the hero stoodNor drew his sable vessels to the flood.“And is it thus divine Laertes’ sonThus fly the Greeks (the martial maid begun)Thus to their country bear their own disgraceAnd fame eternal leave to Priam’s race?Shall beauteous Helen still remain unfreedStill unrevenged a thousand heroes bleed!Haste generous Ithacus! prevent the shameRecall your armies and your chiefs reclaim.Your own resistless eloquence employAnd to the immortals trust the fall of Troy.”,ilias
The voice divine confess’d the warlike maidUlysses heard nor uninspired obey’d:Then meeting first Atrides from his handReceived the imperial sceptre of command.Thus graced attention and respect to gainHe runs he flies through all the Grecian train;Each prince of name or chief in arms approvedHe fired with praise or with persuasion moved.,ilias
“Warriors like you with strength and wisdom bless’dBy brave examples should confirm the rest.The monarch’s will not yet reveal’d appears;He tries our courage but resents our fears.The unwary Greeks his fury may provoke;Not thus the king in secret council spoke.Jove loves our chief from Jove his honour springsBeware! for dreadful is the wrath of kings.”,ilias
But if a clamorous vile plebeian roseHim with reproof he check’d or tamed with blows.“Be still thou slave and to thy betters yield;Unknown alike in council and in field!Ye gods what dastards would our host command!Swept to the war the lumber of a land.Be silent wretch and think not here allow’dThat worst of tyrants an usurping crowd.To one sole monarch Jove commits the sway;His are the laws and him let all obey.”86,ilias
Fierce from his seat at this Ulysses springs87In generous vengeance of the king of kings.With indignation sparkling in his eyesHe views the wretch and sternly thus replies:,ilias
“Peace factious monster born to vex the stateWith wrangling talents form’d for foul debate:Curb that impetuous tongue nor rashly vainAnd singly mad asperse the sovereign reign.Have we not known thee slave! of all our hostThe man who acts the least upbraids the most?Think not the Greeks to shameful flight to bringNor let those lips profane the name of king.For our return we trust the heavenly powers;Be that their care; to fight like men be ours.But grant the host with wealth the general loadExcept detraction what hast thou bestow’d?Suppose some hero should his spoils resignArt thou that hero could those spoils be thine?Gods! let me perish on this hateful shoreAnd let these eyes behold my son no more;If on thy next offence this hand forbearTo strip those arms thou ill deserv’st to wearExpel the council where our princes meetAnd send thee scourged and howling through the fleet.”,ilias
He said and cowering as the dastard bendsThe weighty sceptre on his back descends.88On the round bunch the bloody tumours rise:The tears spring starting from his haggard eyes;Trembling he sat and shrunk in abject fearsFrom his vile visage wiped the scalding tears;While to his neighbour each express’d his thought:,ilias
“Ye gods! what wonders has Ulysses wrought!What fruits his conduct and his courage yield!Great in the council glorious in the field.Generous he rises in the crown’s defenceTo curb the factious tongue of insolenceSuch just examples on offenders shownSedition silence and assert the throne.”,ilias
’Twas thus the general voice the hero praisedWho rising high the imperial sceptre raised:The blue-eyed Pallas his celestial friend(In form a herald) bade the crowds attend.The expecting crowds in still attention hungTo hear the wisdom of his heavenly tongue.Then deeply thoughtful pausing ere he spokeHis silence thus the prudent hero broke:,ilias
Thus prayed the chief: his unavailing prayerGreat Jove refused and toss’d in empty air:The God averse while yet the fumes arosePrepared new toils and doubled woes on woes.Their prayers perform’d the chiefs the rite pursueThe barley sprinkled and the victim slew.The limbs they sever from the inclosing hideThe thighs selected to the gods divide.On these in double cauls involved with artThe choicest morsels lie from every partFrom the cleft wood the crackling flames aspireWhile the fat victims feed the sacred fire.The thighs thus sacrificed and entrails dress’dThe assistants part transfix and roast the rest;Then spread the tables the repast prepareEach takes his seat and each receives his share.Soon as the rage of hunger was suppress’dThe generous Nestor thus the prince address’d.,ilias
“Now bid thy heralds sound the loud alarmsAnd call the squadrons sheathed in brazen arms;Now seize the occasion now the troops surveyAnd lead to war when heaven directs the way.”,ilias
He said; the monarch issued his commands;Straight the loud heralds call the gathering bands;The chiefs inclose their king; the hosts divideIn tribes and nations rank’d on either side.High in the midst the blue-eyed virgin flies;From rank to rank she darts her ardent eyes;The dreadful aegis Jove’s immortal shieldBlazed on her arm and lighten’d all the field:Round the vast orb a hundred serpents roll’dForm’d the bright fringe and seem’d to burn in goldWith this each Grecian’s manly breast she warmsSwells their bold hearts and strings their nervous armsNo more they sigh inglorious to returnBut breathe revenge and for the combat burn.,ilias
Say virgins seated round the throne divineAll-knowing goddesses! immortal nine!100Since earth’s wide regions heaven’s umneasur’d heightAnd hell’s abyss hide nothing from your sight(We wretched mortals! lost in doubts belowBut guess by rumour and but boast we know)O say what heroes fired by thirst of fameOr urged by wrongs to Troy’s destruction came.To count them all demands a thousand tonguesA throat of brass and adamantine lungs.Daughters of Jove assist! inspired by youThe mighty labour dauntless I pursue;What crowded armies from what climes they bringTheir names their numbers and their chiefs I sing.,ilias
The hardy warriors whom Boeotia bredPenelius Leitus Prothoenor led:With these Arcesilaus and Clonius standEqual in arms and equal in command.These head the troops that rocky Aulis yieldsAnd Eteon’s hills and Hyrie’s watery fieldsAnd Schoenos Scholos Graea near the mainAnd Mycalessia’s ample piny plain;Those who in Peteon or Ilesion dwellOr Harma where Apollo’s prophet fell;Heleon and Hyle which the springs o’erflow;And Medeon lofty and Ocalea low;Or in the meads of Haliartus strayOr Thespia sacred to the god of day:Onchestus Neptune’s celebrated groves;Copae and Thisbe famed for silver doves;For flocks Erythrae Glissa for the vine;Platea green and Nysa the divine;And they whom Thebe’s well-built walls incloseWhere Myde Eutresis Corone rose;And Arne rich with purple harvests crown’d;And Anthedon Boeotia’s utmost bound.Full fifty ships they send and each conveysTwice sixty warriors through the foaming seas.102,ilias
To these succeed Aspledon’s martial trainWho plough the spacious Orchomenian plain.Two valiant brothers rule the undaunted throngIalmen and Ascalaphus the strong:Sons of Astyoche the heavenly fairWhose virgin charms subdued the god of war:(In Actor’s court as she retired to restThe strength of Mars the blushing maid compress’d)Their troops in thirty sable vessels sweepWith equal oars the hoarse-resounding deep.,ilias
The Phocians next in forty barks repair;Epistrophus and Schedius head the war:From those rich regions where Cephisus leadsHis silver current through the flowery meads;From Panopea Chrysa the divineWhere Anemoria’s stately turrets shineWhere Pytho Daulis Cyparissus stoodAnd fair Lilaea views the rising flood.These ranged in order on the floating tideClose on the left the bold Boeotians’ side.,ilias
Fierce Ajax led the Locrian squadrons onAjax the less Oileus’ valiant son;Skill’d to direct the flying dart aright;Swift in pursuit and active in the fight.Him as their chief the chosen troops attendWhich Bessa Thronus and rich Cynos send;Opus Calliarus and Scarphe’s bands;And those who dwell where pleasing Augia standsAnd where Boagrius floats the lowly landsOr in fair Tarphe’s sylvan seats reside:In forty vessels cut the yielding tide.,ilias
Euboea next her martial sons preparesAnd sends the brave Abantes to the wars:Breathing revenge in arms they take their wayFrom Chalcis’ walls and strong Eretria;The Isteian fields for generous vines renown’dThe fair Caristos and the Styrian ground;Where Dios from her towers o’erlooks the plainAnd high Cerinthus views the neighbouring main.Down their broad shoulders falls a length of hair;Their hands dismiss not the long lance in air;But with protended spears in fighting fieldsPierce the tough corslets and the brazen shields.Twice twenty ships transport the warlike bandsWhich bold Elphenor fierce in arms commands.,ilias
Full fifty more from Athens stem the mainLed by Menestheus through the liquid plain.(Athens the fair where great Erectheus sway’dThat owed his nurture to the blue-eyed maidBut from the teeming furrow took his birthThe mighty offspring of the foodful earth.Him Pallas placed amidst her wealthy faneAdored with sacrifice and oxen slain;Where as the years revolve her altars blazeAnd all the tribes resound the goddess’ praise.)No chief like thee Menestheus! Greece could yieldTo marshal armies in the dusty fieldThe extended wings of battle to displayOr close the embodied host in firm array.Nestor alone improved by length of daysFor martial conduct bore an equal praise.,ilias
With these appear the Salaminian bandsWhom the gigantic Telamon commands;In twelve black ships to Troy they steer their courseAnd with the great Athenians join their force.,ilias
Next move to war the generous Argive trainFrom high Troezene and Maseta’s plainAnd fair Ægina circled by the main:Whom strong Tyrinthe’s lofty walls surroundAnd Epidaure with viny harvests crown’d:And where fair Asinen and Hermoin showTheir cliffs above and ample bay below.These by the brave Euryalus were ledGreat Sthenelus and greater Diomed;But chief Tydides bore the sovereign sway:In fourscore barks they plough the watery way.,ilias
The proud Mycene arms her martial powersCleone Corinth with imperial towers103Fair Araethyrea Ornia’s fruitful plainAnd Ægion and Adrastus’ ancient reign;And those who dwell along the sandy shoreAnd where Pellene yields her fleecy storeWhere Helice and Hyperesia lieAnd Gonoessa’s spires salute the sky.Great Agamemnon rules the numerous bandA hundred vessels in long order standAnd crowded nations wait his dread command.High on the deck the king of men appearsAnd his refulgent arms in triumph wears;Proud of his host unrivall’d in his reignIn silent pomp he moves along the main.,ilias
His brother follows and to vengeance warmsThe hardy Spartans exercised in arms:Phares and Brysia’s valiant troops and thoseWhom Lacedaemon’s lofty hills inclose;Or Messe’s towers for silver doves renown’dAmyclae Laas Augia’s happy groundAnd those whom OEtylos’ low walls containAnd Helos on the margin of the main.These o’er the bending ocean Helen’s causeIn sixty ships with Menelaus draws:Eager and loud from man to man he fliesRevenge and fury flaming in his eyes;While vainly fond in fancy oft he hearsThe fair one’s grief and sees her falling tears.,ilias
In ninety sail from Pylos’ sandy coastNestor the sage conducts his chosen host:From Amphigenia’s ever-fruitful landWhere Æpy high and little Pteleon stand;Where beauteous Arene her structures showsAnd Thryon’s walls Alpheus’ streams inclose:And Dorion famed for Thamyris’ disgraceSuperior once of all the tuneful raceTill vain of mortals’ empty praise he stroveTo match the seed of cloud-compelling Jove!Too daring bard! whose unsuccessful prideThe immortal Muses in their art defied.The avenging Muses of the light of dayDeprived his eyes and snatch’d his voice away;No more his heavenly voice was heard to singHis hand no more awaked the silver string.,ilias
Where under high Cyllene crown’d with woodThe shaded tomb of old Æpytus stood;From Ripe Stratie Tegea’s bordering townsThe Phenean fields and Orchomenian downsWhere the fat herds in plenteous pasture rove;And Stymphelus with her surrounding grove;Parrhasia on her snowy cliffs reclinedAnd high Enispe shook by wintry windAnd fair Mantinea’s ever-pleasing site;In sixty sail the Arcadian bands unite.Bold Agapenor glorious at their head(Ancaeus’ son) the mighty squadron led.Their ships supplied by Agamemnon’s careThrough roaring seas the wondering warriors bear;The first to battle on the appointed plainBut new to all the dangers of the main.,ilias
Those where fair Elis and Buprasium join;Whom Hyrmin here and Myrsinus confineAnd bounded there where o’er the valleys roseThe Olenian rock; and where Alisium flows;Beneath four chiefs (a numerous army) came:The strength and glory of the Epean name.In separate squadrons these their train divideEach leads ten vessels through the yielding tide.One was Amphimachus and Thalpius one;(Eurytus’ this and that Teatus’ son;)Diores sprung from Amarynceus’ line;And great Polyxenus of force divine.,ilias
But those who view fair Elis o’er the seasFrom the blest islands of the EchinadesIn forty vessels under Meges moveBegot by Phyleus the beloved of Jove:To strong Dulichium from his sire he fledAnd thence to Troy his hardy warriors led.,ilias
Ulysses follow’d through the watery roadA chief in wisdom equal to a god.With those whom Cephalenia’s line inclosedOr till their fields along the coast opposed;Or where fair Ithaca o’erlooks the floodsWhere high Neritos shakes his waving woodsWhere Ægilipa’s rugged sides are seenCrocylia rocky and Zacynthus green.These in twelve galleys with vermilion proresBeneath his conduct sought the Phrygian shores.,ilias
Thoas came next Andraemon’s valiant sonFrom Pleuron’s walls and chalky CalydonAnd rough Pylene and the Olenian steepAnd Chalcis beaten by the rolling deep.He led the warriors from the Ætolian shoreFor now the sons of OEneus were no more!The glories of the mighty race were fled!OEneus himself and Meleager dead!To Thoas’ care now trust the martial trainHis forty vessels follow through the main.,ilias
Next eighty barks the Cretan king commandsOf Gnossus Lyctus and Gortyna’s bands;And those who dwell where Rhytion’s domes ariseOr white Lycastus glitters to the skiesOr where by Phaestus silver Jardan runs;Crete’s hundred cities pour forth all her sons.These march’d Idomeneus beneath thy careAnd Merion dreadful as the god of war.,ilias
Tlepolemus the son of HerculesLed nine swift vessels through the foamy seasFrom Rhodes with everlasting sunshine brightJalyssus Lindus and Camirus white.His captive mother fierce Alcides boreFrom Ephyr’s walls and Selle’s winding shoreWhere mighty towns in ruins spread the plainAnd saw their blooming warriors early slain.The hero when to manly years he grewAlcides’ uncle old Licymnius slew;For this constrain’d to quit his native placeAnd shun the vengeance of the Herculean raceA fleet he built and with a numerous trainOf willing exiles wander’d o’er the main;Where many seas and many sufferings pastOn happy Rhodes the chief arrived at last:There in three tribes divides his native bandAnd rules them peaceful in a foreign land;Increased and prosper’d in their new abodesBy mighty Jove the sire of men and gods;With joy they saw the growing empire riseAnd showers of wealth descending from the skies.,ilias
Three ships with Nireus sought the Trojan shoreNireus whom Aglae to Charopus boreNireus in faultless shape and blooming graceThe loveliest youth of all the Grecian race;104Pelides only match’d his early charms;But few his troops and small his strength in arms.,ilias
Next thirty galleys cleave the liquid plainOf those Calydnae’s sea-girt isles contain;With them the youth of Nisyrus repairCasus the strong and Crapathus the fair;Cos where Eurypylus possess’d the swayTill great Alcides made the realms obey:These Antiphus and bold Phidippus bringSprung from the god by Thessalus the king.,ilias
Now Muse recount Pelasgic Argos’ powersFrom Alos Alope and Trechin’s towers:From Phthia’s spacious vales; and Hella bless’dWith female beauty far beyond the rest.Full fifty ships beneath Achilles’ careThe Achaians Myrmidons Hellenians bear;Thessalians all though various in their name;The same their nation and their chief the same.But now inglorious stretch’d along the shoreThey hear the brazen voice of war no more;No more the foe they face in dire array:Close in his fleet the angry leader lay;Since fair Briseis from his arms was tornThe noblest spoil from sack’d Lyrnessus borneThen when the chief the Theban walls o’erthrewAnd the bold sons of great Evenus slew.There mourn’d Achilles plunged in depth of careBut soon to rise in slaughter blood and war.,ilias
To these the youth of Phylace succeedItona famous for her fleecy breedAnd grassy Pteleon deck’d with cheerful greensThe bowers of Ceres and the sylvan scenes.Sweet Pyrrhasus with blooming flowerets crown’dAnd Antron’s watery dens and cavern’d ground.These own’d as chief Protesilas the braveWho now lay silent in the gloomy grave:The first who boldly touch’d the Trojan shoreAnd dyed a Phrygian lance with Grecian gore;There lies far distant from his native plain;Unfinish’d his proud palaces remainAnd his sad consort beats her breast in vain.His troops in forty ships Podarces ledIphiclus’ son and brother to the dead;Nor he unworthy to command the host;Yet still they mourn’d their ancient leader lost.,ilias
The men who Glaphyra’s fair soil partakeWhere hills incircle Boebe’s lowly lakeWhere Phaere hears the neighbouring waters fallOr proud Iolcus lifts her airy wallIn ten black ships embark’d for Ilion’s shoreWith bold Eumelus whom Alceste bore:All Pelias’ race Alceste far outshinedThe grace and glory of the beauteous kind,ilias
The troops Methone or Thaumacia yieldsOlizon’s rocks or Meliboea’s fieldsWith Philoctetes sail’d whose matchless artFrom the tough bow directs the feather’d dart.Seven were his ships; each vessel fifty rowSkill’d in his science of the dart and bow.But he lay raging on the Lemnian groundA poisonous hydra gave the burning wound;There groan’d the chief in agonizing painWhom Greece at length shall wish nor wish in vain.His forces Medon led from Lemnos’ shoreOileus’ son whom beauteous Rhena bore.,ilias
The Œchalian race in those high towers contain’dWhere once Eurytus in proud triumph reign’dOr where her humbler turrets Tricca rearsOr where Ithome rough with rocks appearsIn thirty sail the sparkling waves divideWhich Podalirius and Machaon guide.To these his skill their parent-god impartsDivine professors of the healing arts.,ilias
The bold Ormenian and Asterian bandsIn forty barks Eurypylus commands.Where Titan hides his hoary head in snowAnd where Hyperia’s silver fountains flow.Thy troops Argissa Polypoetes leadsAnd Eleon shelter’d by Olympus’ shadesGyrtone’s warriors; and where Orthe liesAnd Oloosson’s chalky cliffs arise.Sprung from Pirithous of immortal raceThe fruit of fair Hippodame’s embrace(That day when hurl’d from Pelion’s cloudy headTo distant dens the shaggy Centaurs fled)With Polypoetes join’d in equal swayLeonteus leads and forty ships obey.,ilias
In twenty sail the bold Perrhaebians cameFrom Cyphus Guneus was their leader’s name.With these the Enians join’d and those who freezeWhere cold Dodona lifts her holy trees;Or where the pleasing Titaresius glidesAnd into Peneus rolls his easy tides;Yet o’er the silvery surface pure they flowThe sacred stream unmix’d with streams belowSacred and awful! from the dark abodesStyx pours them forth the dreadful oath of gods!,ilias
Last under Prothous the Magnesians stood(Prothous the swift of old Tenthredon’s blood;)Who dwell where Pelion crown’d with piny boughsObscures the glade and nods his shaggy brows;Or where through flowery Tempe Peneus stray’d:(The region stretch’d beneath his mighty shade:)In forty sable barks they stemm’d the main;Such were the chiefs and such the Grecian train.,ilias
Say next O Muse! of all Achaia breedsWho bravest fought or rein’d the noblest steeds?Eumelus’ mares were foremost in the chaseAs eagles fleet and of Pheretian race;Bred where Pieria’s fruitful fountains flowAnd train’d by him who bears the silver bow.Fierce in the fight their nostrils breathed a flameTheir height their colour and their age the same;O’er fields of death they whirl the rapid carAnd break the ranks and thunder through the war.Ajax in arms the first renown acquiredWhile stern Achilles in his wrath retired:(His was the strength that mortal might exceedsAnd his the unrivall’d race of heavenly steeds:)But Thetis’ son now shines in arms no more;His troops neglected on the sandy shore.In empty air their sportive javelins throwOr whirl the disk or bend an idle bow:Unstain’d with blood his cover’d chariots stand;The immortal coursers graze along the strand;But the brave chiefs the inglorious life deploredAnd wandering o’er the camp required their lord.,ilias
Now like a deluge covering all aroundThe shining armies sweep along the ground;Swift as a flood of fire when storms ariseFloats the wild field and blazes to the skies.Earth groan’d beneath them; as when angry JoveHurls down the forky lightning from aboveOn Arime when he the thunder throwsAnd fires Typhoeus with redoubled blowsWhere Typhon press’d beneath the burning loadStill feels the fury of the avenging god.,ilias
But various Iris Jove’s commands to bearSpeeds on the wings of winds through liquid air;In Priam’s porch the Trojan chiefs she foundThe old consulting and the youths around.Polites’ shape the monarch’s son she choseWho from Æsetes’ tomb observed the foes105High on the mound; from whence in prospect layThe fields the tents the navy and the bay.In this dissembled form she hastes to bringThe unwelcome message to the Phrygian king.,ilias
“Cease to consult the time for action calls;War horrid war approaches to your walls!Assembled armies oft have I beheld;But ne’er till now such numbers charged a field:Thick as autumnal leaves or driving sandThe moving squadrons blacken all the strand.Thou godlike Hector! all thy force employAssemble all the united bands of Troy;In just array let every leader callThe foreign troops: this day demands them all!”,ilias
The voice divine the mighty chief alarms;The council breaks the warriors rush to arms.The gates unfolding pour forth all their trainNations on nations fill the dusky plainMen steeds and chariots shake the trembling ground:The tumult thickens and the skies resound.,ilias
Amidst the plain in sight of Ilion standsA rising mount the work of human hands;(This for Myrinne’s tomb the immortals knowThough call’d Bateia in the world below;)Beneath their chiefs in martial order hereThe auxiliar troops and Trojan hosts appear.,ilias

The fierce Pelasgi next in war renown’dMarch from Larissa’s ever-fertile ground:In equal arms their brother leaders shineHippothous bold and Pyleus the divine.,ilias
Next Acamas and Pyrous lead their hostsIn dread array from Thracia’s wintry coasts;Round the bleak realms where Hellespontus roarsAnd Boreas beats the hoarse-resounding shores.,ilias

The Paphlagonians Pylaemenes rulesWhere rich Henetia breeds her savage mulesWhere Erythinus’ rising cliffs are seenThy groves of box Cytorus! ever greenAnd where Ægialus and Cromna lieAnd lofty Sesamus invades the skyAnd where Parthenius roll’d through banks of flowersReflects her bordering palaces and bowers.,ilias
Here march’d in arms the Halizonian bandWhom Odius and Epistrophus commandFrom those far regions where the sun refinesThe ripening silver in Alybean mines.,ilias
There mighty Chromis led the Mysian trainAnd augur Ennomus inspired in vain;For stern Achilles lopp’d his sacred headRoll’d down Scamander with the vulgar dead.,ilias
Of those who round Maeonia’s realms resideOr whom the vales in shades of Tmolus hideMestles and Antiphus the charge partakeBorn on the banks of Gyges’ silent lake.There from the fields where wild Maeander flowsHigh Mycale and Latmos’ shady browsAnd proud Miletus came the Carian throngsWith mingled clamours and with barbarous tongues.107Amphimachus and Naustes guide the trainNaustes the bold Amphimachus the vainWho trick’d with gold and glittering on his carRode like a woman to the field of war.Fool that he was! by fierce Achilles slainThe river swept him to the briny main:There whelm’d with waves the gaudy warrior liesThe valiant victor seized the golden prize.,ilias
The forces last in fair array succeedWhich blameless Glaucus and Sarpedon leadThe warlike bands that distant Lycia yieldsWhere gulfy Xanthus foams along the fields.,ilias
The armies being ready to engage a single combat is agreed uponbetween Menelaus and Paris (by the intervention of Hector) for thedetermination of the war. Iris is sent to call Helen to behold thefight. She leads her to the walls of Troy where Priam sat with hiscounsellers observing the Grecian leaders on the plain below to whomHelen gives an account of the chief of them. The kings on either parttake the solemn oath for the conditions of the combat. The duel ensues;wherein Paris being overcome he is snatched away in a cloud by Venusand transported to his apartment. She then calls Helen from the wallsand brings the lovers together. Agamemnon on the part of the Greciansdemands the restoration of Helen and the performance of the articles.,ilias
The three-and-twentieth day still continues throughout this book. Thescene is sometimes in the fields before Troy and sometimes in Troyitself.,ilias
Thus by their leaders’ care each martial bandMoves into ranks and stretches o’er the land.With shouts the Trojans rushing from afarProclaim their motions and provoke the war.So when inclement winters vex the plainWith piercing frosts or thick-descending rainTo warmer seas the cranes embodied fly108With noise and order through the midway sky;To pigmy nations wounds and death they bringAnd all the war descends upon the wingBut silent breathing rage resolved and skill’d109By mutual aids to fix a doubtful fieldSwift march the Greeks: the rapid dust aroundDarkening arises from the labour’d ground.Thus from his flaggy wings when Notus shedsA night of vapours round the mountain headsSwift-gliding mists the dusky fields invadeTo thieves more grateful than the midnight shade;While scarce the swains their feeding flocks surveyLost and confused amidst the thicken’d day:So wrapp’d in gathering dust the Grecian trainA moving cloud swept on and hid the plain.,ilias
Now front to front the hostile armies standEager of fight and only wait command;When to the van before the sons of fameWhom Troy sent forth the beauteous Paris came:In form a god! the panther’s speckled hideFlow’d o’er his armour with an easy pride:His bended bow across his shoulders flungHis sword beside him negligently hung;Two pointed spears he shook with gallant graceAnd dared the bravest of the Grecian race.,ilias
As thus with glorious air and proud disdainHe boldly stalk’d the foremost on the plainHim Menelaus loved of Mars espiesWith heart elated and with joyful eyes:So joys a lion if the branching deerOr mountain goat his bulky prize appear;Eager he seizes and devours the slainPress’d by bold youths and baying dogs in vain.Thus fond of vengeance with a furious boundIn clanging arms he leaps upon the groundFrom his high chariot: him approaching nearThe beauteous champion views with marks of fearSmit with a conscious sense retires behindAnd shuns the fate he well deserved to find.As when some shepherd from the rustling trees110Shot forth to view a scaly serpent seesTrembling and pale he starts with wild affrightAnd all confused precipitates his flight:So from the king the shining warrior fliesAnd plunged amid the thickest Trojans lies.,ilias
He said. The challenge Hector heard with joyThen with his spear restrain’d the youth of TroyHeld by the midst athwart; and near the foeAdvanced with steps majestically slow:While round his dauntless head the Grecians pourTheir stones and arrows in a mingled shower.,ilias
Then thus the monarch great Atrides cried:“Forbear ye warriors! lay the darts aside:A parley Hector asks a message bears;We know him by the various plume he wears.”Awed by his high command the Greeks attendThe tumult silence and the fight suspend.,ilias
While from the centre Hector rolls his eyesOn either host and thus to both applies:“Hear all ye Trojan all ye Grecian bandsWhat Paris author of the war demands.Your shining swords within the sheath restrainAnd pitch your lances in the yielding plain.Here in the midst in either army’s sightHe dares the Spartan king to single fight;And wills that Helen and the ravish’d spoilThat caused the contest shall reward the toil.Let these the brave triumphant victor graceAnd different nations part in leagues of peace.”,ilias
“Me too ye warriors hear whose fatal rightA world engages in the toils of fight.To me the labour of the field resign;Me Paris injured; all the war be mine.Fall he that must beneath his rival’s arms;And live the rest secure of future harms.Two lambs devoted by your country’s riteTo earth a sable to the sun a whitePrepare ye Trojans! while a third we bringSelect to Jove the inviolable king.Let reverend Priam in the truce engageAnd add the sanction of considerate age;His sons are faithless headlong in debateAnd youth itself an empty wavering state;Cool age advances venerably wiseTurns on all hands its deep-discerning eyes;Sees what befell and what may yet befallConcludes from both and best provides for all.,ilias
The nations hear with rising hopes possess’dAnd peaceful prospects dawn in every breast.Within the lines they drew their steeds aroundAnd from their chariots issued on the ground;Next all unbuckling the rich mail they woreLaid their bright arms along the sable shore.On either side the meeting hosts are seenWith lances fix’d and close the space between.Two heralds now despatch’d to Troy inviteThe Phrygian monarch to the peaceful rite.,ilias
Meantime to beauteous Helen from the skiesThe various goddess of the rainbow flies:(Like fair Laodice in form and faceThe loveliest nymph of Priam’s royal race:)Her in the palace at her loom she found;The golden web her own sad story crown’dThe Trojan wars she weaved (herself the prize)And the dire triumphs of her fatal eyes.To whom the goddess of the painted bow:“Approach and view the wondrous scene below!112Each hardy Greek and valiant Trojan knightSo dreadful late and furious for the fightNow rest their spears or lean upon their shields;Ceased is the war and silent all the fields.Paris alone and Sparta’s king advanceIn single fight to toss the beamy lance;Each met in arms the fate of combat triesThy love the motive and thy charms the prize.”,ilias
This said the many-coloured maid inspiresHer husband’s love and wakes her former fires;Her country parents all that once were dearRush to her thought and force a tender tearO’er her fair face a snowy veil she threwAnd softly sighing from the loom withdrew.Her handmaids Clymene and Æthra waitHer silent footsteps to the Scaean gate.,ilias
There sat the seniors of the Trojan race:(Old Priam’s chiefs and most in Priam’s grace)The king the first; Thymoetes at his side;Lampus and Clytius long in council tried;Panthus and Hicetaon once the strong;And next the wisest of the reverend throngAntenor grave and sage UcalegonLean’d on the walls and bask’d before the sun:Chiefs who no more in bloody fights engageBut wise through time and narrative with ageIn summer days like grasshoppers rejoiceA bloodless race that send a feeble voice.These when the Spartan queen approach’d the towerIn secret own’d resistless beauty’s power:They cried “No wonder such celestial charms113For nine long years have set the world in arms;What winning graces! what majestic mien!She moves a goddess and she looks a queen!Yet hence O Heaven convey that fatal faceAnd from destruction save the Trojan race.”,ilias
The good old Priam welcomed her and cried“Approach my child and grace thy father’s side.See on the plain thy Grecian spouse appearsThe friends and kindred of thy former years.No crime of thine our present sufferings drawsNot thou but Heaven’s disposing will the causeThe gods these armies and this force employThe hostile gods conspire the fate of Troy.But lift thy eyes and say what Greek is he(Far as from hence these aged orbs can see)Around whose brow such martial graces shineSo tall so awful and almost divine!Though some of larger stature tread the greenNone match his grandeur and exalted mien:He seems a monarch and his country’s pride.”Thus ceased the king and thus the fair replied:,ilias
“Before thy presence father I appearWith conscious shame and reverential fear.Ah! had I died ere to these walls I fledFalse to my country and my nuptial bed;My brothers friends and daughter left behindFalse to them all to Paris only kind!For this I mourn till grief or dire diseaseShall waste the form whose fault it was to please!The king of kings Atrides you surveyGreat in the war and great in arts of sway:My brother once before my days of shame!And oh! that still he bore a brother’s name!”,ilias
With wonder Priam view’d the godlike manExtoll’d the happy prince and thus began:“O bless’d Atrides! born to prosperous fateSuccessful monarch of a mighty state!How vast thy empire! Of your matchless trainWhat numbers lost what numbers yet remain!In Phrygia once were gallant armies knownIn ancient time when Otreus fill’d the throneWhen godlike Mygdon led their troops of horseAnd I to join them raised the Trojan force:Against the manlike Amazons we stood114And Sangar’s stream ran purple with their blood.But far inferior those in martial graceAnd strength of numbers to this Grecian race.”,ilias
This said once more he view’d the warrior train;“What’s he whose arms lie scatter’d on the plain?Broad is his breast his shoulders larger spreadThough great Atrides overtops his head.Nor yet appear his care and conduct small;From rank to rank he moves and orders all.The stately ram thus measures o’er the groundAnd master of the flock surveys them round.”,ilias
Then Helen thus: “Whom your discerning eyesHave singled out is Ithacus the wise;A barren island boasts his glorious birth;His fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth.”,ilias
The king then ask’d (as yet the camp he view’d)“What chief is that with giant strength enduedWhose brawny shoulders and whose swelling chestAnd lofty stature far exceed the rest?“Ajax the great (the beauteous queen replied)Himself a host: the Grecian strength and pride.See! bold Idomeneus superior towersAmid yon circle of his Cretan powersGreat as a god! I saw him once beforeWith Menelaus on the Spartan shore.The rest I know and could in order name;All valiant chiefs and men of mighty fame.Yet two are wanting of the numerous trainWhom long my eyes have sought but sought in vain:Castor and Pollux first in martial forceOne bold on foot and one renown’d for horse.My brothers these; the same our native shoreOne house contain’d us as one mother bore.Perhaps the chiefs from warlike toils at easeFor distant Troy refused to sail the seas;Perhaps their swords some nobler quarrel drawsAshamed to combat in their sister’s cause.”,ilias
So spoke the fair nor knew her brothers’ doom;118Wrapt in the cold embraces of the tomb;Adorn’d with honours in their native shoreSilent they slept and heard of wars no more.,ilias
Meantime the heralds through the crowded townBring the rich wine and destined victims down.Idaeus’ arms the golden goblets press’d119Who thus the venerable king address’d:“Arise O father of the Trojan state!The nations call thy joyful people waitTo seal the truce and end the dire debate.Paris thy son and Sparta’s king advanceIn measured lists to toss the weighty lance;And who his rival shall in arms subdueHis be the dame and his the treasure too.Thus with a lasting league our toils may ceaseAnd Troy possess her fertile fields in peace:So shall the Greeks review their native shoreMuch famed for generous steeds for beauty more.”,ilias
With grief he heard and bade the chiefs prepareTo join his milk-white coursers to the car;He mounts the seat Antenor at his side;The gentle steeds through Scaea’s gates they guide:120Next from the car descending on the plainAmid the Grecian host and Trojan trainSlow they proceed: the sage Ulysses thenArose and with him rose the king of men.On either side a sacred herald standsThe wine they mix and on each monarch’s handsPour the full urn; then draws the Grecian lordHis cutlass sheathed beside his ponderous sword;From the sign’d victims crops the curling hair;121The heralds part it and the princes share;Then loudly thus before the attentive bandsHe calls the gods and spreads his lifted hands:,ilias
“O first and greatest power! whom all obeyWho high on Ida’s holy mountain swayEternal Jove! and you bright orb that rollFrom east to west and view from pole to pole!Thou mother Earth! and all ye living floods!Infernal furies and Tartarean godsWho rule the dead and horrid woes prepareFor perjured kings and all who falsely swear!Hear and be witness. If by Paris slainGreat Menelaus press the fatal plain;The dame and treasures let the Trojan keepAnd Greece returning plough the watery deep.If by my brother’s lance the Trojan bleedBe his the wealth and beauteous dame decreed:The appointed fine let Ilion justly payAnd every age record the signal day.This if the Phrygians shall refuse to yieldArms must revenge and Mars decide the field.”,ilias
With that the chief the tender victims slewAnd in the dust their bleeding bodies threw;The vital spirit issued at the woundAnd left the members quivering on the ground.From the same urn they drink the mingled wineAnd add libations to the powers divine.While thus their prayers united mount the sky“Hear mighty Jove! and hear ye gods on high!And may their blood who first the league confoundShed like this wine disdain the thirsty ground;May all their consorts serve promiscuous lustAnd all their lust be scatter’d as the dust!”Thus either host their imprecations join’dWhich Jove refused and mingled with the wind.,ilias
The rites now finish’d reverend Priam roseAnd thus express’d a heart o’ercharged with woes:“Ye Greeks and Trojans let the chiefs engageBut spare the weakness of my feeble age:In yonder walls that object let me shunNor view the danger of so dear a son.Whose arms shall conquer and what prince shall fallHeaven only knows; for heaven disposes all.”,ilias
This said the hoary king no longer stay’dBut on his car the slaughter’d victims laid:Then seized the reins his gentle steeds to guideAnd drove to Troy Antenor at his side.,ilias
Bold Hector and Ulysses now disposeThe lists of combat and the ground inclose:Next to decide by sacred lots prepareWho first shall launch his pointed spear in air.The people pray with elevated handsAnd words like these are heard through all the bands:“Immortal Jove high Heaven’s superior lordOn lofty Ida’s holy mount adored!Whoe’er involved us in this dire debateO give that author of the war to fateAnd shades eternal! let division ceaseAnd joyful nations join in leagues of peace.”,ilias
With eyes averted Hector hastes to turnThe lots of fight and shakes the brazen urn.Then Paris thine leap’d forth; by fatal chanceOrdain’d the first to whirl the weighty lance.Both armies sat the combat to survey.Beside each chief his azure armour layAnd round the lists the generous coursers neigh.The beauteous warrior now arrays for fightIn gilded arms magnificently bright:The purple cuishes clasp his thighs aroundWith flowers adorn’d with silver buckles bound:Lycaon’s corslet his fair body dress’dBraced in and fitted to his softer breast;A radiant baldric o’er his shoulder tiedSustain’d the sword that glitter’d at his side:His youthful face a polish’d helm o’erspread;The waving horse-hair nodded on his head:His figured shield a shining orb he takesAnd in his hand a pointed javelin shakes.With equal speed and fired by equal charmsThe Spartan hero sheathes his limbs in arms.,ilias
Now round the lists the admiring armies standWith javelins fix’d the Greek and Trojan band.Amidst the dreadful vale the chiefs advanceAll pale with rage and shake the threatening lance.The Trojan first his shining javelin threw;Full on Atrides’ ringing shield it flewNor pierced the brazen orb but with a bound122Leap’d from the buckler blunted on the ground.Atrides then his massy lance preparesIn act to throw but first prefers his prayers:,ilias
“Haste happy nymph! for thee thy Paris callsSafe from the fight in yonder lofty wallsFair as a god; with odours round him spreadHe lies and waits thee on the well-known bed;Not like a warrior parted from the foeBut some gay dancer in the public show.”,ilias
Then thus incensed the Paphian queen replies:“Obey the power from whom thy glories rise:Should Venus leave thee every charm must flyFade from thy cheek and languish in thy eye.Cease to provoke me lest I make thee moreThe world’s aversion than their love before;Now the bright prize for which mankind engageThan the sad victim of the public rage.”,ilias
At this the fairest of her sex obey’dAnd veil’d her blushes in a silken shade;Unseen and silent from the train she movesLed by the goddess of the Smiles and Loves.Arrived and enter’d at the palace gateThe maids officious round their mistress wait;Then all dispersing various tasks attend;The queen and goddess to the prince ascend.Full in her Paris’ sight the queen of loveHad placed the beauteous progeny of Jove;Where as he view’d her charms she turn’d awayHer glowing eyes and thus began to say:,ilias
“Is this the chief who lost to sense of shameLate fled the field and yet survives his fame?O hadst thou died beneath the righteous swordOf that brave man whom once I call’d my lord!The boaster Paris oft desired the dayWith Sparta’s king to meet in single fray:Go now once more thy rival’s rage exciteProvoke Atrides and renew the fight:Yet Helen bids thee stay lest thou unskill’dShouldst fall an easy conquest on the field.”,ilias
The prince replies: “Ah cease divinely fairNor add reproaches to the wounds I bear;This day the foe prevail’d by Pallas’ power:We yet may vanquish in a happier hour:There want not gods to favour us above;But let the business of our life be love:These softer moments let delights employAnd kind embraces snatch the hasty joy.Not thus I loved thee when from Sparta’s shoreMy forced my willing heavenly prize I boreWhen first entranced in Cranae’s isle I lay124Mix’d with thy soul and all dissolved away!”Thus having spoke the enamour’d Phrygian boyRush’d to the bed impatient for the joy.Him Helen follow’d slow with bashful charmsAnd clasp’d the blooming hero in her arms.,ilias
While these to love’s delicious rapture yieldThe stern Atrides rages round the field:So some fell lion whom the woods obeyRoars through the desert and demands his prey.Paris he seeks impatient to destroyBut seeks in vain along the troops of Troy;Even those had yielded to a foe so braveThe recreant warrior hateful as the grave.Then speaking thus the king of kings arose“Ye Trojans Dardans all our generous foes!Hear and attest! from Heaven with conquest crown’dOur brother’s arms the just success have found:Be therefore now the Spartan wealth restor’dLet Argive Helen own her lawful lord;The appointed fine let Ilion justly payAnd age to age record this signal day.”,ilias
The gods deliberate in council concerning the Trojan war: they agreeupon the continuation of it and Jupiter sends down Minerva to breakthe truce. She persuades Pandarus to aim an arrow at Menelaus who iswounded but cured by Machaon. In the meantime some of the Trojantroops attack the Greeks. Agamemnon is distinguished in all the partsof a good general; he reviews the troops and exhorts the leaders someby praises and others by reproof. Nestor is particularly celebrated forhis military discipline. The battle joins and great numbers are slainon both sides.,ilias
The same day continues through this as through the last book (as itdoes also through the two following and almost to the end of theseventh book). The scene is wholly in the field before Troy.,ilias
And now Olympus’ shining gates unfold;The gods with Jove assume their thrones of gold:Immortal Hebe fresh with bloom divineThe golden goblet crowns with purple wine:While the full bowls flow round the powers employTheir careful eyes on long-contended Troy.,ilias
When Jove disposed to tempt Saturnia’s spleenThus waked the fury of his partial queen“Two powers divine the son of Atreus aidImperial Juno and the martial maid;125But high in heaven they sit and gaze from farThe tame spectators of his deeds of war.Not thus fair Venus helps her favour’d knightThe queen of pleasures shares the toils of fightEach danger wards and constant in her careSaves in the moment of the last despair.Her act has rescued Paris’ forfeit lifeThough great Atrides gain’d the glorious strife.Then say ye powers! what signal issue waitsTo crown this deed and finish all the fates!Shall Heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spareOr rouse the furies and awake the war?Yet would the gods for human good provideAtrides soon might gain his beauteous brideStill Priam’s walls in peaceful honours growAnd through his gates the crowding nations flow.”,ilias
Thus while he spoke the queen of heaven enragedAnd queen of war in close consult engaged:Apart they sit their deep designs employAnd meditate the future woes of Troy.Though secret anger swell’d Minerva’s breastThe prudent goddess yet her wrath suppress’d;But Juno impotent of passion brokeHer sullen silence and with fury spoke:,ilias
“Shall then O tyrant of the ethereal reign!My schemes my labours and my hopes be vain?Have I for this shook Ilion with alarmsAssembled nations set two worlds in arms?To spread the war I flew from shore to shore;The immortal coursers scarce the labour bore.At length ripe vengeance o’er their heads impendsBut Jove himself the faithless race defends.Loth as thou art to punish lawless lustNot all the gods are partial and unjust.”,ilias
At this the goddess rolled her radiant eyesThen on the Thunderer fix’d them and replies:“Three towns are Juno’s on the Grecian plainsMore dear than all the extended earth containsMycenae Argos and the Spartan wall;127,ilias
These thou mayst raze nor I forbid their fall:’Tis not in me the vengeance to remove;The crime’s sufficient that they share my love.Of power superior why should I complain?Resent I may but must resent in vain.Yet some distinction Juno might requireSprung with thyself from one celestial sireA goddess born to share the realms aboveAnd styled the consort of the thundering Jove;Nor thou a wife and sister’s right deny;128Let both consent and both by terms comply;So shall the gods our joint decrees obeyAnd heaven shall act as we direct the way.See ready Pallas waits thy high commandsTo raise in arms the Greek and Phrygian bands;Their sudden friendship by her arts may ceaseAnd the proud Trojans first infringe the peace.”,ilias
The sire of men and monarch of the skyThe advice approved and bade Minerva flyDissolve the league and all her arts employTo make the breach the faithless act of Troy.Fired with the charge she headlong urged her flightAnd shot like lightning from Olympus’ height.As the red comet from Saturnius sentTo fright the nations with a dire portent(A fatal sign to armies on the plainOr trembling sailors on the wintry main)With sweeping glories glides along in airAnd shakes the sparkles from its blazing hair:129Between both armies thus in open sightShot the bright goddess in a trail of lightWith eyes erect the gazing hosts admireThe power descending and the heavens on fire!“The gods (they cried) the gods this signal sentAnd fate now labours with some vast event:Jove seals the league or bloodier scenes prepares;Jove the great arbiter of peace and wars.”,ilias
They said while Pallas through the Trojan throng(In shape a mortal) pass’d disguised along.Like bold Laodocus her course she bentWho from Antenor traced his high descent.Amidst the ranks Lycaon’s son she foundThe warlike Pandarus for strength renown’d;Whose squadrons led from black Æsepus’ flood130With flaming shields in martial circle stood.To him the goddess: “Phrygian! canst thou hearA well-timed counsel with a willing ear?What praise were thine couldst thou direct thy dartAmidst his triumph to the Spartan’s heart?What gifts from Troy from Paris wouldst thou gainThy country’s foe the Grecian glory slain?Then seize the occasion dare the mighty deedAim at his breast and may that aim succeed!But first to speed the shaft address thy vowTo Lycian Phoebus with the silver bowAnd swear the firstlings of thy flock to payOn Zelia’s altars to the god of day.”131,ilias
He heard and madly at the motion pleasedHis polish’d bow with hasty rashness seized.’Twas form’d of horn and smooth’d with artful toil:A mountain goat resign’d the shining spoil.Who pierced long since beneath his arrows bled;The stately quarry on the cliffs lay deadAnd sixteen palms his brow’s large honours spread:The workmen join’d and shaped the bended hornsAnd beaten gold each taper point adorns.This by the Greeks unseen the warrior bendsScreen’d by the shields of his surrounding friends:There meditates the mark; and couching lowFits the sharp arrow to the well-strung bow.One from a hundred feather’d deaths he choseFated to wound and cause of future woes;Then offers vows with hecatombs to crownApollo’s altars in his native town.,ilias
Now with full force the yielding horn he bendsDrawn to an arch and joins the doubling ends;Close to his breast he strains the nerve belowTill the barb’d points approach the circling bow;The impatient weapon whizzes on the wing;Sounds the tough horn and twangs the quivering string.,ilias
He said: a leader’s and a brother’s fearsPossess his soul which thus the Spartan cheers:“Let not thy words the warmth of Greece abate;The feeble dart is guiltless of my fate:Stiff with the rich embroider’d work aroundMy varied belt repell’d the flying wound.”,ilias
To whom the king: “My brother and my friendThus always thus may Heaven thy life defend!Now seek some skilful hand whose powerful artMay stanch the effusion and extract the dart.Herald be swift and bid Machaon bringHis speedy succour to the Spartan king;Pierced with a winged shaft (the deed of Troy)The Grecian’s sorrow and the Dardan’s joy.”,ilias
With hasty zeal the swift Talthybius flies;Through the thick files he darts his searching eyesAnd finds Machaon where sublime he stands132In arms incircled with his native bands.Then thus: “Machaon to the king repairHis wounded brother claims thy timely care;Pierced by some Lycian or Dardanian bowA grief to us a triumph to the foe.”,ilias
The heavy tidings grieved the godlike man:Swift to his succour through the ranks he ran.The dauntless king yet standing firm he foundAnd all the chiefs in deep concern around.Where to the steely point the reed was join’dThe shaft he drew but left the head behind.Straight the broad belt with gay embroidery gracedHe loosed; the corslet from his breast unbraced;Then suck’d the blood and sovereign balm infused133Which Chiron gave and Æsculapius used.,ilias
While round the prince the Greeks employ their careThe Trojans rush tumultuous to the war;Once more they glitter in refulgent armsOnce more the fields are fill’d with dire alarms.Nor had you seen the king of men appearConfused unactive or surprised with fear;But fond of glory with severe delightHis beating bosom claim’d the rising fight.No longer with his warlike steeds he stay’dOr press’d the car with polish’d brass inlaidBut left Eurymedon the reins to guide;The fiery coursers snorted at his side.On foot through all the martial ranks he movesAnd these encourages and those reproves.“Brave men!” he cries (to such who boldly dareUrge their swift steeds to face the coming war)“Your ancient valour on the foes approve;Jove is with Greece and let us trust in Jove.’Tis not for us but guilty Troy to dreadWhose crimes sit heavy on her perjured head;Her sons and matrons Greece shall lead in chainsAnd her dead warriors strew the mournful plains.”,ilias
Thus with new ardour he the brave inspires;Or thus the fearful with reproaches fires:“Shame to your country scandal of your kind;Born to the fate ye well deserve to find!Why stand ye gazing round the dreadful plainPrepared for flight but doom’d to fly in vain?Confused and panting thus the hunted deerFalls as he flies a victim to his fear.Still must ye wait the foes and still retireTill yon tall vessels blaze with Trojan fire?Or trust ye Jove a valiant foe shall chaseTo save a trembling heartless dastard race?”,ilias
Charm’d with this heat the king his course pursuesAnd next the troops of either Ajax views:In one firm orb the bands were ranged aroundA cloud of heroes blacken’d all the ground.Thus from the lofty promontory’s browA swain surveys the gathering storm below;Slow from the main the heavy vapours riseSpread in dim streams and sail along the skiesTill black as night the swelling tempest showsThe cloud condensing as the west-wind blows:He dreads the impending storm and drives his flockTo the close covert of an arching rock.,ilias
Such and so thick the embattled squadrons stoodWith spears erect a moving iron wood:A shady light was shot from glimmering shieldsAnd their brown arms obscured the dusky fields.,ilias
“O heroes! worthy such a dauntless trainWhose godlike virtue we but urge in vain(Exclaim’d the king) who raise your eager bandsWith great examples more than loud commands.Ah! would the gods but breathe in all the restSuch souls as burn in your exalted breastSoon should our arms with just success be crown’dAnd Troy’s proud walls lie smoking on the ground.”,ilias
So spoke the master of the martial artAnd touch’d with transport great Atrides’ heart.“Oh! hadst thou strength to match thy brave desiresAnd nerves to second what thy soul inspires!But wasting years that wither human raceExhaust thy spirits and thy arms unbrace.What once thou wert oh ever mightst thou be!And age the lot of any chief but thee.”,ilias
Thus to the experienced prince Atrides cried;He shook his hoary locks and thus replied:“Well might I wish could mortal wish renew134That strength which once in boiling youth I knew;Such as I was when Ereuthalion slainBeneath this arm fell prostrate on the plain.But heaven its gifts not all at once bestowsThese years with wisdom crowns with action those:The field of combat fits the young and boldThe solemn council best becomes the old:To you the glorious conflict I resignLet sage advice the palm of age be mine.”,ilias
He said. With joy the monarch march’d beforeAnd found Menestheus on the dusty shoreWith whom the firm Athenian phalanx stands;And next Ulysses with his subject bands.Remote their forces lay nor knew so farThe peace infringed nor heard the sounds of war;The tumult late begun they stood intentTo watch the motion dubious of the event.The king who saw their squadrons yet unmovedWith hasty ardour thus the chiefs reproved:,ilias
“Can Peleus’ son forget a warrior’s part.And fears Ulysses skill’d in every art?Why stand you distant and the rest expectTo mix in combat which yourselves neglect?From you ’twas hoped among the first to dareThe shock of armies and commence the war;For this your names are call’d before the restTo share the pleasures of the genial feast:And can you chiefs! without a blush surveyWhole troops before you labouring in the fray?Say is it thus those honours you requite?The first in banquets but the last in fight.”,ilias
Ulysses heard: the hero’s warmth o’erspreadHis cheek with blushes: and severe he said:“Take back the unjust reproach! Behold we standSheathed in bright arms and but expect command.If glorious deeds afford thy soul delightBehold me plunging in the thickest fight.Then give thy warrior-chief a warrior’s dueWho dares to act whate’er thou dar’st to view.”Struck with his generous wrath the king replies:,ilias
“O great in action and in council wise!With ours thy care and ardour are the sameNor need I to commend nor aught to blame.Sage as thou art and learn’d in human kindForgive the transport of a martial mind.Haste to the fight secure of just amends;The gods that make shall keep the worthy friends.”,ilias
No words the godlike Diomed return’dBut heard respectful and in secret burn’d:Not so fierce Capaneus’ undaunted son;Stern as his sire the boaster thus begun:,ilias
“What needs O monarch! this invidious praiseOurselves to lessen while our sire you raise?Dare to be just Atrides! and confessOur value equal though our fury less.With fewer troops we storm’d the Theban wallAnd happier saw the sevenfold city fall137In impious acts the guilty father died;The sons subdued for Heaven was on their side.Far more than heirs of all our parents’ fameOur glories darken their diminish’d name.”,ilias
To him Tydides thus: “My friend forbear;Suppress thy passion and the king revere:His high concern may well excuse this rageWhose cause we follow and whose war we wage:His the first praise were Ilion’s towers o’erthrownAnd if we fail the chief disgrace his own.Let him the Greeks to hardy toils excite’Tis ours to labour in the glorious fight.”,ilias
Now shield with shield with helmet helmet closedTo armour armour lance to lance opposedHost against host with shadowy squadrons drewThe sounding darts in iron tempests flewVictors and vanquish’d join’d promiscuous criesAnd shrilling shouts and dying groans arise;With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyedAnd slaughter’d heroes swell the dreadful tide.,ilias
As torrents roll increased by numerous rillsWith rage impetuous down their echoing hillsRush to the vales and pour’d along the plainRoar through a thousand channels to the main:The distant shepherd trembling hears the sound;So mix both hosts and so their cries rebound.,ilias
The bold Antilochus the slaughter ledThe first who struck a valiant Trojan dead:At great Echepolus the lance arrivesRazed his high crest and through his helmet drives;Warm’d in the brain the brazen weapon liesAnd shades eternal settle o’er his eyes.So sinks a tower that long assaults had stoodOf force and fire its walls besmear’d with blood.Him the bold leader of the Abantian throng140Seized to despoil and dragg’d the corpse along:But while he strove to tug the inserted dartAgenor’s javelin reach’d the hero’s heart.His flank unguarded by his ample shieldAdmits the lance: he falls and spurns the field;The nerves unbraced support his limbs no more;The soul comes floating in a tide of gore.Trojans and Greeks now gather round the slain;The war renews the warriors bleed again:As o’er their prey rapacious wolves engageMan dies on man and all is blood and rage.,ilias
In blooming youth fair Simoisius fellSent by great Ajax to the shades of hell;Fair Simoisius whom his mother boreAmid the flocks on silver Simois’ shore:The nymph descending from the hills of IdeTo seek her parents on his flowery sideBrought forth the babe their common care and joyAnd thence from Simois named the lovely boy.Short was his date! by dreadful Ajax slainHe falls and renders all their cares in vain!So falls a poplar that in watery groundRaised high the head with stately branches crown’d(Fell’d by some artist with his shining steelTo shape the circle of the bending wheel)Cut down it lies tall smooth and largely spreadWith all its beauteous honours on its headThere left a subject to the wind and rainAnd scorch’d by suns it withers on the plainThus pierced by Ajax Simoisius liesStretch’d on the shore and thus neglected dies.,ilias
At Ajax Antiphus his javelin threw;The pointed lance with erring fury flewAnd Leucus loved by wise Ulysses slew.He drops the corpse of Simoisius slainAnd sinks a breathless carcase on the plain.This saw Ulysses and with grief enragedStrode where the foremost of the foes engaged;Arm’d with his spear he meditates the woundIn act to throw; but cautious look’d aroundStruck at his sight the Trojans backward drewAnd trembling heard the javelin as it flew.A chief stood nigh who from Abydos cameOld Priam’s son Democoon was his name.The weapon entered close above his earCold through his temples glides the whizzing spear;141With piercing shrieks the youth resigns his breathHis eye-balls darken with the shades of death;Ponderous he falls; his clanging arms resoundAnd his broad buckler rings against the ground.,ilias
Seized with affright the boldest foes appear;E’en godlike Hector seems himself to fear;Slow he gave way the rest tumultuous fled;The Greeks with shouts press on and spoil the dead:But Phoebus now from Ilion’s towering heightShines forth reveal’d and animates the fight.“Trojans be bold and force with force oppose;Your foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes!Nor are their bodies rocks nor ribb’d with steel;Your weapons enter and your strokes they feel.Have ye forgot what seem’d your dread before?The great the fierce Achilles fights no more.”,ilias
Apollo thus from Ilion’s lofty towersArray’d in terrors roused the Trojan powers:While war’s fierce goddess fires the Grecian foeAnd shouts and thunders in the fields below.Then great Diores fell by doom divineIn vain his valour and illustrious line.A broken rock the force of Pyrus threw(Who from cold Ænus led the Thracian crew)142Full on his ankle dropp’d the ponderous stoneBurst the strong nerves and crash’d the solid bone.Supine he tumbles on the crimson sandsBefore his helpless friends and native bandsAnd spreads for aid his unavailing hands.The foe rush’d furious as he pants for breathAnd through his navel drove the pointed death:His gushing entrails smoked upon the groundAnd the warm life came issuing from the wound.,ilias
His lance bold Thoas at the conqueror sentDeep in his breast above the pap it wentAmid the lungs was fix’d the winged woodAnd quivering in his heaving bosom stood:Till from the dying chief approaching nearThe Ætolian warrior tugg’d his weighty spear:Then sudden waved his flaming falchion roundAnd gash’d his belly with a ghastly wound;The corpse now breathless on the bloody plainTo spoil his arms the victor strove in vain;The Thracian bands against the victor press’dA grove of lances glitter’d at his breast.Stern Thoas glaring with revengeful eyesIn sullen fury slowly quits the prize.,ilias
Thus fell two heroes; one the pride of ThraceAnd one the leader of the Epeian race;Death’s sable shade at once o’ercast their eyesIn dust the vanquish’d and the victor lies.With copious slaughter all the fields are redAnd heap’d with growing mountains of the dead.,ilias
Had some brave chief this martial scene beheldBy Pallas guarded through the dreadful field;Might darts be bid to turn their points awayAnd swords around him innocently play;The war’s whole art with wonder had he seenAnd counted heroes where he counted men.,ilias
Diomed assisted by Pallas performs wonders in this day’s battle.Pandarus wounds him with an arrow but the goddess cures him enableshim to discern gods from mortals and prohibits him from contendingwith any of the former excepting Venus. Æneas joins Pandarus to opposehim; Pandarus is killed and Æneas in great danger but for theassistance of Venus; who as she is removing her son from the fight iswounded on the hand by Diomed. Apollo seconds her in his rescue and atlength carries off Æneas to Troy where he is healed in the temple ofPergamus. Mars rallies the Trojans and assists Hector to make a stand.In the meantime Æneas is restored to the field and they overthrowseveral of the Greeks; among the rest Tlepolemus is slain by Sarpedon.Juno and Minerva descend to resist Mars; the latter incites Diomed togo against that god; he wounds him and sends him groaning to heaven.,ilias
But Pallas now Tydides’ soul inspires143Fills with her force and warms with all her firesAbove the Greeks his deathless fame to raiseAnd crown her hero with distinguish’d praise.High on his helm celestial lightnings playHis beamy shield emits a living ray;The unwearied blaze incessant streams suppliesLike the red star that fires the autumnal skiesWhen fresh he rears his radiant orb to sightAnd bathed in ocean shoots a keener light.Such glories Pallas on the chief bestow’dSuch from his arms the fierce effulgence flow’d:Onward she drives him furious to engageWhere the fight burns and where the thickest rage.,ilias
The sons of Dares first the combat soughtA wealthy priest but rich without a fault;In Vulcan’s fane the father’s days were ledThe sons to toils of glorious battle bred;These singled from their troops the fight maintainThese from their steeds Tydides on the plain.Fierce for renown the brother-chiefs draw nearAnd first bold Phegeus cast his sounding spearWhich o’er the warrior’s shoulder took its courseAnd spent in empty air its erring force.Not so Tydides flew thy lance in vainBut pierced his breast and stretch’d him on the plain.Seized with unusual fear Idaeus fledLeft the rich chariot and his brother dead.And had not Vulcan lent celestial aidHe too had sunk to death’s eternal shade;But in a smoky cloud the god of firePreserved the son in pity to the sire.The steeds and chariot to the navy ledIncreased the spoils of gallant Diomed.,ilias
Struck with amaze and shame the Trojan crewOr slain or fled the sons of Dares view;When by the blood-stain’d hand Minerva press’dThe god of battles and this speech address’d:,ilias
“Stern power of war! by whom the mighty fallWho bathe in blood and shake the lofty wall!Let the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide;And whose the conquest mighty Jove decide:While we from interdicted fields retireNor tempt the wrath of heaven’s avenging sire.”,ilias
Her words allay the impetuous warrior’s heatThe god of arms and martial maid retreat;Removed from fight on Xanthus’ flowery boundsThey sat and listen’d to the dying sounds.,ilias
Meantime the Greeks the Trojan race pursueAnd some bold chieftain every leader slew:First Odius falls and bites the bloody sandHis death ennobled by Atrides’ hand:,ilias
As he to flight his wheeling car address’dThe speedy javelin drove from back to breast.In dust the mighty Halizonian layHis arms resound the spirit wings its way.,ilias
Thy fate was next O Phaestus! doom’d to feelThe great Idomeneus’ protended steel;Whom Borus sent (his son and only joy)From fruitful Tarne to the fields of Troy.The Cretan javelin reach’d him from afarAnd pierced his shoulder as he mounts his car;Back from the car he tumbles to the groundAnd everlasting shades his eyes surround.,ilias
Then died Scamandrius expert in the chaseIn woods and wilds to wound the savage race;Diana taught him all her sylvan artsTo bend the bow and aim unerring darts:But vainly here Diana’s arts he triesThe fatal lance arrests him as he flies;From Menelaus’ arm the weapon sentThrough his broad back and heaving bosom went:Down sinks the warrior with a thundering soundHis brazen armour rings against the ground.,ilias
Next artful Phereclus untimely fell;Bold Merion sent him to the realms of hell.Thy father’s skill O Phereclus! was thineThe graceful fabric and the fair design;For loved by Pallas Pallas did impartTo him the shipwright’s and the builder’s art.Beneath his hand the fleet of Paris roseThe fatal cause of all his country’s woes;But he the mystic will of heaven unknownNor saw his country’s peril nor his own.The hapless artist while confused he fledThe spear of Merion mingled with the dead.Through his right hip with forceful fury castBetween the bladder and the bone it pass’d;Prone on his knees he falls with fruitless criesAnd death in lasting slumber seals his eyes.,ilias
From Meges’ force the swift Pedaeus fledAntenor’s offspring from a foreign bedWhose generous spouse Theanor heavenly fairNursed the young stranger with a mother’s care.How vain those cares! when Meges in the rearFull in his nape infix’d the fatal spear;Swift through his crackling jaws the weapon glidesAnd the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides.,ilias
Then died Hypsenor generous and divineSprung from the brave Dolopion’s mighty lineWho near adored Scamander made abodePriest of the stream and honoured as a god.On him amidst the flying numbers foundEurypylus inflicts a deadly wound;On his broad shoulders fell the forceful brandThence glancing downwards lopp’d his holy handWhich stain’d with sacred blood the blushing sand.Down sunk the priest: the purple hand of deathClosed his dim eye and fate suppress’d his breath.,ilias
Thus toil’d the chiefs in different parts engaged.In every quarter fierce Tydides raged;Amid the Greek amid the Trojan trainRapt through the ranks he thunders o’er the plain;Now here now there he darts from place to placePours on the rear or lightens in their face.Thus from high hills the torrents swift and strongDeluge whole fields and sweep the trees alongThrough ruin’d moles the rushing wave resoundsO’erwhelm’s the bridge and bursts the lofty bounds;The yellow harvests of the ripen’d yearAnd flatted vineyards one sad waste appear!144While Jove descends in sluicy sheets of rainAnd all the labours of mankind are vain.,ilias
So raged Tydides boundless in his ireDrove armies back and made all Troy retire.With grief the leader of the Lycian bandSaw the wide waste of his destructive hand:His bended bow against the chief he drew;Swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flewWhose forky point the hollow breastplate toreDeep in his shoulder pierced and drank the gore:The rushing stream his brazen armour dyedWhile the proud archer thus exulting cried:,ilias
“Hither ye Trojans hither drive your steeds!Lo! by our hand the bravest Grecian bleedsNot long the deathful dart he can sustain;Or Phoebus urged me to these fields in vain.”So spoke he boastful: but the winged dartStopp’d short of life and mock’d the shooter’s art.The wounded chief behind his car retiredThe helping hand of Sthenelus required;Swift from his seat he leap’d upon the groundAnd tugg’d the weapon from the gushing wound;When thus the king his guardian power address’dThe purple current wandering o’er his vest:,ilias
“O progeny of Jove! unconquer’d maid!If e’er my godlike sire deserved thy aidIf e’er I felt thee in the fighting field;Now goddess now thy sacred succour yield.O give my lance to reach the Trojan knightWhose arrow wounds the chief thou guard’st in fight;And lay the boaster grovelling on the shoreThat vaunts these eyes shall view the light no more.”,ilias
Thus pray’d Tydides and Minerva heardHis nerves confirm’d his languid spirits cheer’d;He feels each limb with wonted vigour light;His beating bosom claim’d the promised fight.“Be bold (she cried) in every combat shineWar be thy province thy protection mine;Rush to the fight and every foe control;Wake each paternal virtue in thy soul:Strength swells thy boiling breast infused by meAnd all thy godlike father breathes in thee;Yet more from mortal mists I purge thy eyes145And set to view the warring deities.These see thou shun through all the embattled plain;Nor rashly strive where human force is vain.If Venus mingle in the martial bandHer shalt thou wound: so Pallas gives command.”,ilias
Young Xanthus next and Thoon felt his rage;The joy and hope of Phaenops’ feeble age:Vast was his wealth and these the only heirsOf all his labours and a life of cares.Cold death o’ertakes them in their blooming yearsAnd leaves the father unavailing tears:To strangers now descends his heapy storeThe race forgotten and the name no more.,ilias
Two sons of Priam in one chariot rideGlittering in arms and combat side by side.As when the lordly lion seeks his foodWhere grazing heifers range the lonely woodHe leaps amidst them with a furious boundBends their strong necks and tears them to the ground:So from their seats the brother chiefs are tornTheir steeds and chariot to the navy borne.,ilias
With deep concern divine Æneas view’dThe foe prevailing and his friends pursued;Through the thick storm of singing spears he fliesExploring Pandarus with careful eyes.At length he found Lycaon’s mighty son;To whom the chief of Venus’ race begun:,ilias
“Where Pandarus are all thy honours nowThy winged arrows and unerring bowThy matchless skill thy yet unrivall’d fameAnd boasted glory of the Lycian name?O pierce that mortal! if we mortal callThat wondrous force by which whole armies fall;Or god incensed who quits the distant skiesTo punish Troy for slighted sacrifice;(Which oh avert from our unhappy state!For what so dreadful as celestial hate)?Whoe’er he be propitiate Jove with prayer;If man destroy; if god entreat to spare.”,ilias
“Too late O friend! my rashness I deplore;These shafts once fatal carry death no more.Tydeus’ and Atreus’ sons their points have foundAnd undissembled gore pursued the wound.In vain they bleed: this unavailing bowServes not to slaughter but provoke the foe.In evil hour these bended horns I strungAnd seized the quiver where it idly hung.Cursed be the fate that sent me to the fieldWithout a warrior’s arms the spear and shield!If e’er with life I quit the Trojan plainIf e’er I see my spouse and sire againThis bow unfaithful to my glorious aimsBroke by my hand shall feed the blazing flames.”,ilias
To whom the leader of the Dardan race:“Be calm nor Phoebus’ honour’d gift disgrace.The distant dart be praised though here we needThe rushing chariot and the bounding steed.Against yon hero let us bend our courseAnd hand to hand encounter force with force.Now mount my seat and from the chariot’s heightObserve my father’s steeds renown’d in fight;Practised alike to turn to stop to chaseTo dare the shock or urge the rapid race;Secure with these through fighting fields we go;Or safe to Troy if Jove assist the foe.Haste seize the whip and snatch the guiding rein;The warrior’s fury let this arm sustain;Or if to combat thy bold heart inclineTake thou the spear the chariot’s care be mine.”,ilias
“O prince! (Lycaon’s valiant son replied)As thine the steeds be thine the task to guide.The horses practised to their lord’s commandShall bear the rein and answer to thy hand;But if unhappy we desert the fightThy voice alone can animate their flight;Else shall our fates be number’d with the deadAnd these the victor’s prize in triumph led.Thine be the guidance then: with spear and shieldMyself will charge this terror of the field.”,ilias
And now both heroes mount the glittering car;The bounding coursers rush amidst the war;Their fierce approach bold Sthenelus espiedWho thus alarm’d to great Tydides cried:,ilias
“O friend! two chiefs of force immense I seeDreadful they come and bend their rage on thee:Lo the brave heir of old Lycaon’s lineAnd great Æneas sprung from race divine!Enough is given to fame. Ascend thy car!And save a life the bulwark of our war.”,ilias
He said then shook the ponderous lance and flung;On his broad shield the sounding weapon rungPierced the tough orb and in his cuirass hung“He bleeds! the pride of Greece! (the boaster cries)Our triumph now the mighty warrior lies!”“Mistaken vaunter! (Diomed replied;)Thy dart has erred and now my spear be tried;Ye ’scape not both; one headlong from his carWith hostile blood shall glut the god of war.”,ilias
He spoke and rising hurl’d his forceful dartWhich driven by Pallas pierced a vital part;Full in his face it enter’d and betwixtThe nose and eye-ball the proud Lycian fix’d;Crash’d all his jaws and cleft the tongue withinTill the bright point look’d out beneath the chin.Headlong he falls his helmet knocks the ground:Earth groans beneath him and his arms resound;The starting coursers tremble with affright;The soul indignant seeks the realms of night.,ilias
Nor Sthenelus with unassisting handsRemain’d unheedful of his lord’s commands:His panting steeds removed from out the warHe fix’d with straiten’d traces to the carNext rushing to the Dardan spoil detainsThe heavenly coursers with the flowing manes:These in proud triumph to the fleet convey’dNo longer now a Trojan lord obey’d.That charge to bold Deipylus he gave(Whom most he loved as brave men love the brave)Then mounting on his car resumed the reinAnd follow’d where Tydides swept the plain.,ilias
Then with a voice that shook the vaulted skiesThe king insults the goddess as she flies:“Ill with Jove’s daughter bloody fights agreeThe field of combat is no scene for thee:Go let thy own soft sex employ thy careGo lull the coward or delude the fair.Taught by this stroke renounce the war’s alarmsAnd learn to tremble at the name of arms.”,ilias
Then she: “This insult from no god I foundAn impious mortal gave the daring wound!Behold the deed of haughty Diomed!’Twas in the son’s defence the mother bled.The war with Troy no more the Grecians wage;But with the gods (the immortal gods) engage.”,ilias
Dione then: “Thy wrongs with patience bearAnd share those griefs inferior powers must share:Unnumber’d woes mankind from us sustainAnd men with woes afflict the gods again.The mighty Mars in mortal fetters bound149And lodged in brazen dungeons undergroundFull thirteen moons imprison’d roar’d in vain;Otus and Ephialtes held the chain:Perhaps had perish’d had not Hermes’ careRestored the groaning god to upper air.Great Juno’s self has borne her weight of painThe imperial partner of the heavenly reign;Amphitryon’s son infix’d the deadly dart150And fill’d with anguish her immortal heart.E’en hell’s grim king Alcides’ power confess’dThe shaft found entrance in his iron breast;To Jove’s high palace for a cure he fledPierced in his own dominions of the dead;Where Paeon sprinkling heavenly balm aroundAssuaged the glowing pangs and closed the wound.Rash impious man! to stain the bless’d abodesAnd drench his arrows in the blood of gods!,ilias
“But thou (though Pallas urged thy frantic deed)Whose spear ill-fated makes a goddess bleedKnow thou whoe’er with heavenly power contendsShort is his date and soon his glory ends;From fields of death when late he shall retireNo infant on his knees shall call him sire.Strong as thou art some god may yet be foundTo stretch thee pale and gasping on the ground;Thy distant wife Ægiale the fair151Starting from sleep with a distracted airShall rouse thy slaves and her lost lord deploreThe brave the great the glorious now no more!”,ilias
This said she wiped from Venus’ wounded palmThe sacred ichor and infused the balm.Juno and Pallas with a smile survey’dAnd thus to Jove began the blue-eyed maid:,ilias
“Permit thy daughter gracious Jove! to tellHow this mischance the Cyprian queen befellAs late she tried with passion to inflameThe tender bosom of a Grecian dame;Allured the fair with moving thoughts of joyTo quit her country for some youth of Troy;The clasping zone with golden buckles boundRazed her soft hand with this lamented wound.”,ilias
The sire of gods and men superior smiledAnd calling Venus thus address’d his child:“Not these O daughter are thy proper caresThee milder arts befit and softer wars;Sweet smiles are thine and kind endearing charms;To Mars and Pallas leave the deeds of arms.”,ilias
Thus they in heaven: while on the plain belowThe fierce Tydides charged his Dardan foeFlush’d with celestial blood pursued his wayAnd fearless dared the threatening god of day;Already in his hopes he saw him kill’dThough screen’d behind Apollo’s mighty shield.Thrice rushing furious at the chief he strook;His blazing buckler thrice Apollo shook:He tried the fourth: when breaking from the cloudA more than mortal voice was heard aloud.,ilias
“O son of Tydeus cease! be wise and seeHow vast the difference of the gods and thee;Distance immense! between the powers that shineAbove eternal deathless and divineAnd mortal man! a wretch of humble birthA short-lived reptile in the dust of earth.”,ilias
So spoke the god who darts celestial fires:He dreads his fury and some steps retires.Then Phoebus bore the chief of Venus’ raceTo Troy’s high fane and to his holy place;Latona there and Phoebe heal’d the woundWith vigour arm’d him and with glory crown’d.This done the patron of the silver bowA phantom raised the same in shape and showWith great Æneas; such the form he boreAnd such in fight the radiant arms he wore.Around the spectre bloody wars are wagedAnd Greece and Troy with clashing shields engaged.Meantime on Ilion’s tower Apollo stoodAnd calling Mars thus urged the raging god:,ilias
“Stern power of arms by whom the mighty fall;Who bathest in blood and shakest the embattled wallRise in thy wrath! to hell’s abhorr’d abodesDespatch yon Greek and vindicate the gods.First rosy Venus felt his brutal rage;Me next he charged and dares all heaven engage:The wretch would brave high heaven’s immortal sireHis triple thunder and his bolts of fire.”,ilias
The god of battle issues on the plainStirs all the ranks and fires the Trojan train;In form like Acamas the Thracian guideEnraged to Troy’s retiring chiefs he cried:,ilias
“How long ye sons of Priam! will ye flyAnd unrevenged see Priam’s people die?Still unresisted shall the foe destroyAnd stretch the slaughter to the gates of Troy?Lo brave Æneas sinks beneath his woundNot godlike Hector more in arms renown’d:Haste all and take the generous warrior’s part.He said;—new courage swell’d each hero’s heart.Sarpedon first his ardent soul express’dAnd turn’d to Hector these bold words address’d:,ilias
Stung to the heart the generous Hector hearsBut just reproof with decent silence bears.From his proud car the prince impetuous springsOn earth he leaps his brazen armour rings.Two shining spears are brandish’d in his hands;Thus arm’d he animates his drooping bandsRevives their ardour turns their steps from flightAnd wakes anew the dying flames of fight.They turn they stand; the Greeks their fury dareCondense their powers and wait the growing war.,ilias
Stern Diomed with either Ajax stoodAnd great Ulysses bathed in hostile blood.Embodied close the labouring Grecian trainThe fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain.Unmoved and silent the whole war they waitSerenely dreadful and as fix’d as fate.So when the embattled clouds in dark arrayAlong the skies their gloomy lines display;When now the North his boisterous rage has spentAnd peaceful sleeps the liquid element:The low-hung vapours motionless and stillRest on the summits of the shaded hill;Till the mass scatters as the winds ariseDispersed and broken through the ruffled skies.,ilias
Nor was the general wanting to his train;From troop to troop he toils through all the plain“Ye Greeks be men! the charge of battle bear;Your brave associates and yourselves revere!Let glorious acts more glorious acts inspireAnd catch from breast to breast the noble fire!On valour’s side the odds of combat lieThe brave live glorious or lamented die;The wretch who trembles in the field of fameMeets death and worse than death eternal shame!”,ilias
These words he seconds with his flying lanceTo meet whose point was strong Deicoon’s chance:Æneas’ friend and in his native placeHonour’d and loved like Priam’s royal race:Long had he fought the foremost in the fieldBut now the monarch’s lance transpierced his shield:His shield too weak the furious dart to stayThrough his broad belt the weapon forced its way:The grisly wound dismiss’d his soul to hellHis arms around him rattled as he fell.,ilias
First Pylaemenes great in battle bledWho sheathed in brass the Paphlagonians led.Atrides mark’d him where sublime he stood;Fix’d in his throat the javelin drank his blood.The faithful Mydon as he turn’d from fightHis flying coursers sunk to endless night;A broken rock by Nestor’s son was thrown:His bended arm received the falling stone;From his numb’d hand the ivory-studded reinsDropp’d in the dust are trail’d along the plains:Meanwhile his temples feel a deadly wound;He groans in death and ponderous sinks to ground:Deep drove his helmet in the sands and thereThe head stood fix’d the quivering legs in airTill trampled flat beneath the coursers’ feet:The youthful victor mounts his empty seatAnd bears the prize in triumph to the fleet.,ilias
Great Hector saw and raging at the viewPours on the Greeks: the Trojan troops pursue:He fires his host with animating criesAnd brings along the furies of the skiesMars stern destroyer! and Bellona dreadFlame in the front and thunder at their head:This swells the tumult and the rage of fight;That shakes a spear that casts a dreadful light.Where Hector march’d the god of battles shinedNow storm’d before him and now raged behind.,ilias
Tydides paused amidst his full career;Then first the hero’s manly breast knew fear.As when some simple swain his cot forsakesAnd wide through fens an unknown journey takes:If chance a swelling brook his passage stayAnd foam impervious ’cross the wanderer’s wayConfused he stops a length of country pass’dEyes the rough waves and tired returns at last.Amazed no less the great Tydides stands:He stay’d and turning thus address’d his bands:,ilias
“No wonder Greeks! that all to Hector yield;Secure of favouring gods he takes the field;His strokes they second and avert our spears.Behold where Mars in mortal arms appears!Retire then warriors but sedate and slow;Retire but with your faces to the foe.Trust not too much your unavailing might;’Tis not with Troy but with the gods ye fight.”,ilias
While thus they strive Tlepolemus the great153Urged by the force of unresisted fateBurns with desire Sarpedon’s strength to prove;Alcides’ offspring meets the son of Jove.Sheathed in bright arms each adverse chief came on.Jove’s great descendant and his greater son.Prepared for combat ere the lance he toss’dThe daring Rhodian vents his haughty boast:,ilias
“What brings this Lycian counsellor so farTo tremble at our arms not mix in war!Know thy vain self nor let their flattery moveWho style thee son of cloud-compelling Jove.How far unlike those chiefs of race divineHow vast the difference of their deeds and thine!Jove got such heroes as my sire whose soulNo fear could daunt nor earth nor hell control.Troy felt his arm and yon proud ramparts standRaised on the ruins of his vengeful hand:With six small ships and but a slender trainHe left the town a wide-deserted plain.But what art thou who deedless look’st aroundWhile unrevenged thy Lycians bite the ground!Small aid to Troy thy feeble force can be;But wert thou greater thou must yield to me.Pierced by my spear to endless darkness go!I make this present to the shades below.”,ilias
“Thy sire O prince! o’erturn’d the Trojan stateWhose perjured monarch well deserved his fate;Those heavenly steeds the hero sought so farFalse he detain’d the just reward of war.Nor so content the generous chief defiedWith base reproaches and unmanly pride.But you unworthy the high race you boastShall raise my glory when thy own is lost:Now meet thy fate and by Sarpedon slainAdd one more ghost to Pluto’s gloomy reign.”,ilias
He said: both javelins at an instant flew;Both struck both wounded but Sarpedon’s slew:Full in the boaster’s neck the weapon stoodTransfix’d his throat and drank the vital blood;The soul disdainful seeks the caves of nightAnd his seal’d eyes for ever lose the light.,ilias
Yet not in vain Tlepolemus was thrownThy angry lance; which piercing to the boneSarpedon’s thigh had robb’d the chief of breath;But Jove was present and forbade the death.Borne from the conflict by his Lycian throngThe wounded hero dragg’d the lance along.(His friends each busied in his several partThrough haste or danger had not drawn the dart.)The Greeks with slain Tlepolemus retired;Whose fall Ulysses view’d with fury fired;Doubtful if Jove’s great son he should pursueOr pour his vengeance on the Lycian crew.But heaven and fate the first design withstandNor this great death must grace Ulysses’ hand.Minerva drives him on the Lycian train;Alastor Cronius Halius strew’d the plainAlcander Prytanis Noemon fell:154And numbers more his sword had sent to hellBut Hector saw; and furious at the sightRush’d terrible amidst the ranks of fight.With joy Sarpedon view’d the wish’d reliefAnd faint lamenting thus implored the chief:,ilias
“O suffer not the foe to bear awayMy helpless corpse an unassisted prey;If I unbless’d must see my son no moreMy much-loved consort and my native shoreYet let me die in Ilion’s sacred wall;Troy in whose cause I fell shall mourn my fall.”,ilias
He said nor Hector to the chief repliesBut shakes his plume and fierce to combat flies;Swift as a whirlwind drives the scattering foes;And dyes the ground with purple as he goes.,ilias
Beneath a beech Jove’s consecrated shadeHis mournful friends divine Sarpedon laid:Brave Pelagon his favourite chief was nighWho wrench’d the javelin from his sinewy thigh.The fainting soul stood ready wing’d for flightAnd o’er his eye-balls swam the shades of night;But Boreas rising fresh with gentle breathRecall’d his spirit from the gates of death.,ilias
The generous Greeks recede with tardy paceThough Mars and Hector thunder in their face;None turn their backs to mean ignoble flightSlow they retreat and even retreating fight.Who first who last by Mars’ and Hector’s handStretch’d in their blood lay gasping on the sand?Tenthras the great Orestes the renown’dFor managed steeds and Trechus press’d the ground;Next OEnomaus and OEnops’ offspring died;Oresbius last fell groaning at their side:Oresbius in his painted mitre gayIn fat Boeotia held his wealthy swayWhere lakes surround low Hyle’s watery plain;A prince and people studious of their gain.,ilias
The carnage Juno from the skies survey’dAnd touch’d with grief bespoke the blue-eyed maid:“Oh sight accursed! Shall faithless Troy prevailAnd shall our promise to our people fail?How vain the word to Menelaus givenBy Jove’s great daughter and the queen of heavenBeneath his arms that Priam’s towers should fallIf warring gods for ever guard the wall!Mars red with slaughter aids our hated foes:Haste let us arm and force with force oppose!”,ilias
She spoke; Minerva burns to meet the war:And now heaven’s empress calls her blazing car.At her command rush forth the steeds divine;Rich with immortal gold their trappings shine.Bright Hebe waits; by Hebe ever youngThe whirling wheels are to the chariot hung.On the bright axle turns the bidden wheelOf sounding brass; the polished axle steel.Eight brazen spokes in radiant order flame;The circles gold of uncorrupted frameSuch as the heavens produce: and round the goldTwo brazen rings of work divine were roll’d.The bossy naves of sold silver shone;Braces of gold suspend the moving throne:The car behind an arching figure bore;The bending concave form’d an arch before.Silver the beam the extended yoke was goldAnd golden reins the immortal coursers hold.Herself impatient to the ready carThe coursers joins and breathes revenge and war.,ilias
Pallas disrobes; her radiant veil untiedWith flowers adorn’d with art diversified(The laboured veil her heavenly fingers wove)Flows on the pavement of the court of Jove.Now heaven’s dread arms her mighty limbs investJove’s cuirass blazes on her ample breast;Deck’d in sad triumph for the mournful fieldO’er her broad shoulders hangs his horrid shieldDire black tremendous! Round the margin roll’dA fringe of serpents hissing guards the gold:Here all the terrors of grim War appearHere rages Force here tremble Flight and FearHere storm’d Contention and here Fury frown’dAnd the dire orb portentous Gorgon crown’d.The massy golden helm she next assumesThat dreadful nods with four o’ershading plumes;So vast the broad circumference containsA hundred armies on a hundred plains.The goddess thus the imperial car ascends;Shook by her arm the mighty javelin bendsPonderous and huge; that when her fury burnsProud tyrants humbles and whole hosts o’erturns.,ilias
Swift at the scourge the ethereal coursers flyWhile the smooth chariot cuts the liquid sky.Heaven’s gates spontaneous open to the powers155Heaven’s golden gates kept by the winged Hours;156Commission’d in alternate watch they standThe sun’s bright portals and the skies commandInvolve in clouds the eternal gates of dayOr the dark barrier roll with ease away.The sounding hinges ring on either sideThe gloomy volumes pierced with light divide.The chariot mounts where deep in ambient skiesConfused Olympus’ hundred heads arise;Where far apart the Thunderer fills his throneO’er all the gods superior and alone.There with her snowy hand the queen restrainsThe fiery steeds and thus to Jove complains:,ilias
“O sire! can no resentment touch thy soul?Can Mars rebel and does no thunder roll?What lawless rage on yon forbidden plainWhat rash destruction! and what heroes slain!Venus and Phoebus with the dreadful bowSmile on the slaughter and enjoy my woe.Mad furious power! whose unrelenting mindNo god can govern and no justice bind.Say mighty father! shall we scourge this prideAnd drive from fight the impetuous homicide?”,ilias
To whom assenting thus the Thunderer said:“Go! and the great Minerva be thy aid.To tame the monster-god Minerva knowsAnd oft afflicts his brutal breast with woes.”,ilias
He said; Saturnia ardent to obeyLash’d her white steeds along the aerial way.Swift down the steep of heaven the chariot rollsBetween the expanded earth and starry poles.Far as a shepherd from some point on high157O’er the wide main extends his boundless eyeThrough such a space of air with thundering soundAt every leap the immortal coursers boundTroy now they reach’d and touch’d those banks divineWhere silver Simois and Scamander join.There Juno stopp’d and (her fair steeds unloosed)Of air condensed a vapour circumfused:For these impregnate with celestial dewOn Simois’ brink ambrosial herbage grew.Thence to relieve the fainting Argive throngSmooth as the sailing doves they glide along.,ilias
The best and bravest of the Grecian band(A warlike circle) round Tydides stand.Such was their look as lions bathed in bloodOr foaming boars the terror of the wood.Heaven’s empress mingles with the mortal crowdAnd shouts in Stentor’s sounding voice aloud;Stentor the strong endued with brazen lungs158Whose throats surpass’d the force of fifty tongues.,ilias
“Inglorious Argives! to your race a shameAnd only men in figure and in name!Once from the walls your timorous foes engagedWhile fierce in war divine Achilles raged;Now issuing fearless they possess the plainNow win the shores and scarce the seas remain.”,ilias
Her speech new fury to their hearts convey’d;While near Tydides stood the Athenian maid;The king beside his panting steeds she foundO’erspent with toil reposing on the ground;To cool his glowing wound he sat apart(The wound inflicted by the Lycian dart.)Large drops of sweat from all his limbs descendBeneath his ponderous shield his sinews bendWhose ample belt that o’er his shoulder layHe eased; and wash’d the clotted gore away.The goddess leaning o’er the bending yokeBeside his coursers thus her silence broke:,ilias
“Degenerate prince! and not of Tydeus’ kindWhose little body lodged a mighty mind;Foremost he press’d in glorious toils to shareAnd scarce refrain’d when I forbade the war.Alone unguarded once he dared to goAnd feast incircled by the Theban foe;There braved and vanquish’d many a hardy knight;Such nerves I gave him and such force in fight.Thou too no less hast been my constant care;Thy hands I arm’d and sent thee forth to war:But thee or fear deters or sloth detains;No drop of all thy father warms thy veins.”,ilias
The chief thus answered mild: “Immortal maid!I own thy presence and confess thy aid.Not fear thou know’st withholds me from the plainsNor sloth hath seized me but thy word restrains:From warring gods thou bad’st me turn my spearAnd Venus only found resistance here.Hence goddess! heedful of thy high commandsLoth I gave way and warn’d our Argive bands:For Mars the homicide these eyes beheldWith slaughter red and raging round the field.”,ilias
Then thus Minerva:—“Brave Tydides hear!Not Mars himself nor aught immortal fear.Full on the god impel thy foaming horse:Pallas commands and Pallas lends thee force.Rash furious blind from these to those he fliesAnd every side of wavering combat tries;Large promise makes and breaks the promise made:Now gives the Grecians now the Trojans aid.”159,ilias
She said and to the steeds approaching nearDrew from his seat the martial charioteer.The vigorous power the trembling car ascendsFierce for revenge; and Diomed attends:The groaning axle bent beneath the load;So great a hero and so great a god.She snatch’d the reins she lash’d with all her forceAnd full on Mars impelled the foaming horse:But first to hide her heavenly visage spreadBlack Orcus’ helmet o’er her radiant head.,ilias
Him thus upbraiding with a wrathful lookThe lord of thunders view’d and stern bespoke:“To me perfidious! this lamenting strain?Of lawless force shall lawless Mars complain?Of all the gods who tread the spangled skiesThou most unjust most odious in our eyes!Inhuman discord is thy dire delightThe waste of slaughter and the rage of fight.No bounds no law thy fiery temper quellsAnd all thy mother in thy soul rebels.In vain our threats in vain our power we use;She gives the example and her son pursues.Yet long the inflicted pangs thou shall not mournSprung since thou art from Jove and heavenly-born.Else singed with lightning hadst thou hence been thrownWhere chain’d on burning rocks the Titans groan.”,ilias
Thus he who shakes Olympus with his nod;Then gave to Paeon’s care the bleeding god.160With gentle hand the balm he pour’d aroundAnd heal’d the immortal flesh and closed the wound.As when the fig’s press’d juice infused in creamTo curds coagulates the liquid streamSudden the fluids fix the parts combined;Such and so soon the ethereal texture join’d.Cleansed from the dust and gore fair Hebe dress’dHis mighty limbs in an immortal vest.Glorious he sat in majesty restoredFast by the throne of heaven’s superior lord.Juno and Pallas mount the bless’d abodesTheir task perform’d and mix among the gods.,ilias
The gods having left the field the Grecians prevail. Helenus thechief augur of Troy commands Hector to return to the city in order toappoint a solemn procession of the queen and the Trojan matrons to thetemple of Minerva to entreat her to remove Diomed from the fight. Thebattle relaxing during the absence of Hector Glaucus and Diomed havean interview between the two armies; where coming to the knowledge ofthe friendship and hospitality passed between their ancestors theymake exchange of their arms. Hector having performed the orders ofHelenus prevails upon Paris to return to the battle and taking atender leave of his wife Andromache hastens again to the field.,ilias
The scene is first in the field of battle between the rivers Simoisand Scamander and then changes to Troy.,ilias
Now heaven forsakes the fight: the immortals yieldTo human force and human skill the field:Dark showers of javelins fly from foes to foes;Now here now there the tide of combat flows;While Troy’s famed streams that bound the deathful plainOn either side run purple to the main.,ilias
Great Ajax first to conquest led the wayBroke the thick ranks and turn’d the doubtful day.The Thracian Acamas his falchion foundAnd hew’d the enormous giant to the ground;His thundering arm a deadly stroke impress’dWhere the black horse-hair nodded o’er his crest;Fix’d in his front the brazen weapon liesAnd seals in endless shades his swimming eyes.Next Teuthras’ son distain’d the sands with bloodAxylus hospitable rich and good:In fair Arisbe’s walls (his native place)161He held his seat! a friend to human race.Fast by the road his ever-open doorObliged the wealthy and relieved the poor.To stern Tydides now he falls a preyNo friend to guard him in the dreadful day!Breathless the good man fell and by his sideHis faithful servant old Calesius died.,ilias
By great Euryalus was Dresus slainAnd next he laid Opheltius on the plain.Two twins were near bold beautiful and youngFrom a fair naiad and Bucolion sprung:(Laomedon’s white flocks Bucolion fedThat monarch’s first-born by a foreign bed;In secret woods he won the naiad’s graceAnd two fair infants crown’d his strong embrace:)Here dead they lay in all their youthful charms;The ruthless victor stripp’d their shining arms.,ilias
Astyalus by Polypoetes fell;Ulysses’ spear Pidytes sent to hell;By Teucer’s shaft brave Aretaon bledAnd Nestor’s son laid stern Ablerus dead;Great Agamemnon leader of the braveThe mortal wound of rich Elatus gaveWho held in Pedasus his proud abode162And till’d the banks where silver Satnio flow’d.Melanthius by Eurypylus was slain;And Phylacus from Leitus flies in vain.,ilias
Unbless’d Adrastus next at mercy liesBeneath the Spartan spear a living prize.Scared with the din and tumult of the fightHis headlong steeds precipitate in flightRush’d on a tamarisk’s strong trunk and brokeThe shatter’d chariot from the crooked yoke;Wide o’er the field resistless as the windFor Troy they fly and leave their lord behind.Prone on his face he sinks beside the wheel:Atrides o’er him shakes his vengeful steel;The fallen chief in suppliant posture press’dThe victor’s knees and thus his prayer address’d:,ilias
“O spare my youth and for the life I oweLarge gifts of price my father shall bestow.When fame shall tell that not in battle slainThy hollow ships his captive son detain:Rich heaps of brass shall in thy tent be told163And steel well-temper’d and persuasive gold.”,ilias
He said: compassion touch’d the hero’s heartHe stood suspended with the lifted dart:As pity pleaded for his vanquish’d prizeStern Agamemnon swift to vengeance fliesAnd furious thus: “Oh impotent of mind!164Shall these shall these Atrides’ mercy find?Well hast thou known proud Troy’s perfidious landAnd well her natives merit at thy hand!Not one of all the race nor sex nor ageShall save a Trojan from our boundless rage:Ilion shall perish whole and bury all;Her babes her infants at the breast shall fall;165A dreadful lesson of exampled fateTo warn the nations and to curb the great!”,ilias
The monarch spoke; the words with warmth address’dTo rigid justice steel’d his brother’s breast.Fierce from his knees the hapless chief he thrust;The monarch’s javelin stretch’d him in the dustThen pressing with his foot his panting heartForth from the slain he tugg’d the reeking dart.Old Nestor saw and roused the warrior’s rage;“Thus heroes! thus the vigorous combat wage;No son of Mars descend for servile gainsTo touch the booty while a foe remains.Behold yon glittering host your future spoil!First gain the conquest then reward the toil.”,ilias
And now had Greece eternal fame acquiredAnd frighted Troy within her walls retiredHad not sage Helenus her state redress’dTaught by the gods that moved his sacred breast.Where Hector stood with great Æneas join’dThe seer reveal’d the counsels of his mind:,ilias
Hector obedient heard: and with a boundLeap’d from his trembling chariot to the ground;Through all his host inspiring force he fliesAnd bids the thunder of the battle rise.With rage recruited the bold Trojans glowAnd turn the tide of conflict on the foe:Fierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears;All Greece recedes and ’midst her triumphs fears;Some god they thought who ruled the fate of warsShot down avenging from the vault of stars.,ilias
Then thus aloud: “Ye dauntless Dardans hear!And you whom distant nations send to war!Be mindful of the strength your fathers bore;Be still yourselves and Hector asks no more.One hour demands me in the Trojan wallTo bid our altars flame and victims fall:Nor shall I trust the matrons’ holy trainAnd reverend elders seek the gods in vain.”,ilias
This said with ample strides the hero pass’d;The shield’s large orb behind his shoulder castHis neck o’ershading to his ankle hung;And as he march’d the brazen buckler rung.,ilias
Now paused the battle (godlike Hector gone)167Where daring Glaucus and great Tydeus’ sonBetween both armies met: the chiefs from farObserved each other and had mark’d for war.Near as they drew Tydides thus began:,ilias
“What or from whence I am or who my sire(Replied the chief) can Tydeus’ son inquire?Like leaves on trees the race of man is foundNow green in youth now withering on the ground;Another race the following spring supplies;They fall successive and successive rise:So generations in their course decay;So flourish these when those are pass’d away.But if thou still persist to search my birthThen hear a tale that fills the spacious earth.,ilias
“This pest he slaughter’d (for he read the skiesAnd trusted heaven’s informing prodigies)Then met in arms the Solymaean crew169(Fiercest of men) and those the warrior slew;Next the bold Amazons’ whole force defied;And conquer’d still for heaven was on his side.,ilias
“Nor ended here his toils: his Lycian foesAt his return a treacherous ambush roseWith levell’d spears along the winding shore:There fell they breathless and return’d no more.,ilias
Thus having said the gallant chiefs alightTheir hands they join their mutual faith they plight;Brave Glaucus then each narrow thought resign’d(Jove warm’d his bosom and enlarged his mind)For Diomed’s brass arms of mean deviceFor which nine oxen paid (a vulgar price)He gave his own of gold divinely wrought171A hundred beeves the shining purchase bought.,ilias
Meantime the guardian of the Trojan stateGreat Hector enter’d at the Scaean gate.172Beneath the beech-tree’s consecrated shadesThe Trojan matrons and the Trojan maidsAround him flock’d all press’d with pious careFor husbands brothers sons engaged in war.He bids the train in long procession goAnd seek the gods to avert the impending woe.And now to Priam’s stately courts he cameRais’d on arch’d columns of stupendous frame;O’er these a range of marble structure runsThe rich pavilions of his fifty sonsIn fifty chambers lodged: and rooms of state173Opposed to those where Priam’s daughters sate.Twelve domes for them and their loved spouses shoneOf equal beauty and of polish’d stone.Hither great Hector pass’d nor pass’d unseenOf royal Hecuba his mother-queen.(With her Laodice whose beauteous faceSurpass’d the nymphs of Troy’s illustrious race.)Long in a strict embrace she held her sonAnd press’d his hand and tender thus begun:,ilias
“O Hector! say what great occasion callsMy son from fight when Greece surrounds our walls;Com’st thou to supplicate the almighty powerWith lifted hands from Ilion’s lofty tower?Stay till I bring the cup with Bacchus crown’dIn Jove’s high name to sprinkle on the groundAnd pay due vows to all the gods around.Then with a plenteous draught refresh thy soulAnd draw new spirits from the generous bowl;Spent as thou art with long laborious fightThe brave defender of thy country’s right.”,ilias
This heard she gave command: and summon’d cameEach noble matron and illustrious dame.The Phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe wentWhere treasured odours breathed a costly scent.There lay the vestures of no vulgar artSidonian maids embroider’d every partWhom from soft Sidon youthful Paris boreWith Helen touching on the Tyrian shore.Here as the queen revolved with careful eyesThe various textures and the various dyesShe chose a veil that shone superior farAnd glow’d refulgent as the morning star.Herself with this the long procession leads;The train majestically slow proceeds.Soon as to Ilion’s topmost tower they comeAnd awful reach the high Palladian domeAntenor’s consort fair Theano waitsAs Pallas’ priestess and unbars the gates.With hands uplifted and imploring eyesThey fill the dome with supplicating cries.The priestess then the shining veil displaysPlaced on Minerva’s knees and thus she prays:,ilias
“Oh awful goddess! ever-dreadful maidTroy’s strong defence unconquer’d Pallas aid!Break thou Tydides’ spear and let him fallProne on the dust before the Trojan wall!So twelve young heifers guiltless of the yokeShall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke.But thou atoned by penitence and prayerOurselves our infants and our city spare!”So pray’d the priestess in her holy fane;So vow’d the matrons but they vow’d in vain.,ilias
While these appear before the power with prayersHector to Paris’ lofty dome repairs.175Himself the mansion raised from every partAssembling architects of matchless art.Near Priam’s court and Hector’s palace standsThe pompous structure and the town commands.A spear the hero bore of wondrous strengthOf full ten cubits was the lance’s lengthThe steely point with golden ringlets join’dBefore him brandish’d at each motion shinedThus entering in the glittering rooms he foundHis brother-chief whose useless arms lay roundHis eyes delighting with their splendid showBrightening the shield and polishing the bow.Beside him Helen with her virgins standsGuides their rich labours and instructs their hands.,ilias
Him thus inactive with an ardent lookThe prince beheld and high-resenting spoke.“Thy hate to Troy is this the time to show?(O wretch ill-fated and thy country’s foe!)Paris and Greece against us both conspireThy close resentment and their vengeful ire.For thee great Ilion’s guardian heroes fallTill heaps of dead alone defend her wallFor thee the soldier bleeds the matron mournsAnd wasteful war in all its fury burns.Ungrateful man! deserves not this thy careOur troops to hearten and our toils to share?Rise or behold the conquering flames ascendAnd all the Phrygian glories at an end.”,ilias
“Brother ’tis just (replied the beauteous youth)Thy free remonstrance proves thy worth and truth:Yet charge my absence less O generous chief!On hate to Troy than conscious shame and grief:Here hid from human eyes thy brother sateAnd mourn’d in secret his and Ilion’s fate.’Tis now enough; now glory spreads her charmsAnd beauteous Helen calls her chief to arms.Conquest to-day my happier sword may bless’Tis man’s to fight but heaven’s to give success.But while I arm contain thy ardent mind;Or go and Paris shall not lag behind.”,ilias
“Oh generous brother! (if the guilty dameThat caused these woes deserve a sister’s name!)Would heaven ere all these dreadful deeds were doneThe day that show’d me to the golden sunHad seen my death! why did not whirlwinds bearThe fatal infant to the fowls of air?Why sunk I not beneath the whelming tideAnd midst the roarings of the waters died?Heaven fill’d up all my ills and I accursedBore all and Paris of those ills the worst.Helen at least a braver spouse might claimWarm’d with some virtue some regard of fame!Now tired with toils thy fainting limbs reclineWith toils sustain’d for Paris’ sake and mineThe gods have link’d our miserable doomOur present woe and infamy to come:Wide shall it spread and last through ages longExample sad! and theme of future song.”,ilias
The chief replied: “This time forbids to rest;The Trojan bands by hostile fury press’dDemand their Hector and his arm require;The combat urges and my soul’s on fire.Urge thou thy knight to march where glory callsAnd timely join me ere I leave the walls.Ere yet I mingle in the direful frayMy wife my infant claim a moment’s stay;This day (perhaps the last that sees me here)Demands a parting word a tender tear:This day some god who hates our Trojan landMay vanquish Hector by a Grecian hand.”,ilias
He said and pass’d with sad presaging heartTo seek his spouse his soul’s far dearer part;At home he sought her but he sought in vain;She with one maid of all her menial trainHad hence retired; and with her second joyThe young Astyanax the hope of TroyPensive she stood on Ilion’s towery heightBeheld the war and sicken’d at the sight;There her sad eyes in vain her lord exploreOr weep the wounds her bleeding country bore.,ilias
But he who found not whom his soul desiredWhose virtue charm’d him as her beauty firedStood in the gates and ask’d “what way she bentHer parting step? If to the fane she wentWhere late the mourning matrons made resort;Or sought her sisters in the Trojan court?”“Not to the court (replied the attendant train)Nor mix’d with matrons to Minerva’s fane:To Ilion’s steepy tower she bent her wayTo mark the fortunes of the doubtful day.Troy fled she heard before the Grecian sword;She heard and trembled for her absent lord:Distracted with surprise she seem’d to flyFear on her cheek and sorrow in her eye.The nurse attended with her infant boyThe young Astyanax the hope of Troy.”,ilias
Hector this heard return’d without delay;Swift through the town he trod his former wayThrough streets of palaces and walks of state;And met the mourner at the Scaean gate.With haste to meet him sprung the joyful fair.His blameless wife Aetion’s wealthy heir(Cilician Thebe great Aetion sway’dAnd Hippoplacus’ wide extended shade):The nurse stood near in whose embraces press’dHis only hope hung smiling at her breastWhom each soft charm and early grace adornFair as the new-born star that gilds the morn.To this loved infant Hector gave the nameScamandrius from Scamander’s honour’d stream;Astyanax the Trojans call’d the boyFrom his great father the defence of Troy.Silent the warrior smiled and pleased resign’dTo tender passions all his mighty mind;His beauteous princess cast a mournful lookHung on his hand and then dejected spoke;Her bosom laboured with a boding sighAnd the big tear stood trembling in her eye.,ilias
“By the same arm my seven brave brothers fell;In one sad day beheld the gates of hell;While the fat herds and snowy flocks they fedAmid their fields the hapless heroes bled!My mother lived to wear the victor’s bandsThe queen of Hippoplacia’s sylvan lands:Redeem’d too late she scarce beheld againHer pleasing empire and her native plainWhen ah! oppress’d by life-consuming woeShe fell a victim to Diana’s bow.,ilias
“Yet while my Hector still survives I seeMy father mother brethren all in thee:Alas! my parents brothers kindred allOnce more will perish if my Hector fallThy wife thy infant in thy danger share:Oh prove a husband’s and a father’s care!That quarter most the skilful Greeks annoyWhere yon wild fig-trees join the wall of Troy;Thou from this tower defend the important post;There Agamemnon points his dreadful hostThat pass Tydides Ajax strive to gainAnd there the vengeful Spartan fires his train.Thrice our bold foes the fierce attack have givenOr led by hopes or dictated from heaven.Let others in the field their arms employBut stay my Hector here and guard his Troy.”,ilias
The chief replied: “That post shall be my careNot that alone but all the works of war.How would the sons of Troy in arms renown’dAnd Troy’s proud dames whose garments sweep the groundAttaint the lustre of my former nameShould Hector basely quit the field of fame?My early youth was bred to martial painsMy soul impels me to the embattled plains!Let me be foremost to defend the throneAnd guard my father’s glories and my own.,ilias
Thus having spoke the illustrious chief of TroyStretch’d his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy.The babe clung crying to his nurse’s breastScared at the dazzling helm and nodding crest.With secret pleasure each fond parent smiledAnd Hector hasted to relieve his childThe glittering terrors from his brows unboundAnd placed the beaming helmet on the ground;Then kiss’d the child and lifting high in airThus to the gods preferr’d a father’s prayer:,ilias
“O thou! whose glory fills the ethereal throneAnd all ye deathless powers! protect my son!Grant him like me to purchase just renownTo guard the Trojans to defend the crownAgainst his country’s foes the war to wageAnd rise the Hector of the future age!So when triumphant from successful toilsOf heroes slain he bears the reeking spoilsWhole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaimAnd say ‘This chief transcends his father’s fame:’While pleased amidst the general shouts of TroyHis mother’s conscious heart o’erflows with joy.”,ilias
He spoke and fondly gazing on her charmsRestored the pleasing burden to her arms;Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laidHush’d to repose and with a smile survey’d.The troubled pleasure soon chastised by fearShe mingled with a smile a tender tear.The soften’d chief with kind compassion view’dAnd dried the falling drops and thus pursued:,ilias
“Andromache! my soul’s far better partWhy with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart?No hostile hand can antedate my doomTill fate condemns me to the silent tomb.Fix’d is the term to all the race of earth;And such the hard condition of our birth:No force can then resist no flight can saveAll sink alike the fearful and the brave.No more—but hasten to thy tasks at homeThere guide the spindle and direct the loom:Me glory summons to the martial sceneThe field of combat is the sphere for men.Where heroes war the foremost place I claimThe first in danger as the first in fame.”,ilias
Thus having said the glorious chief resumesHis towery helmet black with shading plumes.His princess parts with a prophetic sighUnwilling parts and oft reverts her eyeThat stream’d at every look; then moving slowSought her own palace and indulged her woe.There while her tears deplored the godlike manThrough all her train the soft infection ran;The pious maids their mingled sorrows shedAnd mourn the living Hector as the dead.,ilias
But now no longer deaf to honour’s callForth issues Paris from the palace wall.In brazen arms that cast a gleamy raySwift through the town the warrior bends his way.The wanton courser thus with reins unbound176Breaks from his stall and beats the trembling ground;Pamper’d and proud he seeks the wonted tidesAnd laves in height of blood his shining sides;His head now freed he tosses to the skies;His mane dishevell’d o’er his shoulders flies;He snuffs the females in the distant plainAnd springs exulting to his fields again.With equal triumph sprightly bold and gayIn arms refulgent as the god of dayThe son of Priam glorying in his mightRush’d forth with Hector to the fields of fight.,ilias
And now the warriors passing on the wayThe graceful Paris first excused his stay.To whom the noble Hector thus replied:“O chief! in blood and now in arms allied!Thy power in war with justice none contest;Known is thy courage and thy strength confess’d.What pity sloth should seize a soul so braveOr godlike Paris live a woman’s slave!My heart weeps blood at what the Trojans sayAnd hopes thy deeds shall wipe the stain away.Haste then in all their glorious labours shareFor much they suffer for thy sake in war.These ills shall cease whene’er by Jove’s decreeWe crown the bowl to heaven and liberty:While the proud foe his frustrate triumphs mournsAnd Greece indignant through her seas returns.”,ilias
The three and twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax thenext day the truce is agreed; another is taken up in the funeral ritesof the slain and one more in building the fortification before theships. So that somewhat about three days is employed in this book. Thescene lies wholly in the field.,ilias
So spoke the guardian of the Trojan stateThen rush’d impetuous through the Scaean gate.Him Paris follow’d to the dire alarms;Both breathing slaughter both resolved in arms.As when to sailors labouring through the mainThat long have heaved the weary oar in vainJove bids at length the expected gales arise;The gales blow grateful and the vessel flies.So welcome these to Troy’s desiring trainThe bands are cheer’d the war awakes again.,ilias
Bold Paris first the work of death begunOn great Menestheus Areithous’ sonSprung from the fair Philomeda’s embraceThe pleasing Arne was his native place.Then sunk Eioneus to the shades belowBeneath his steely casque he felt the blow177Full on his neck from Hector’s weighty hand;And roll’d with limbs relax’d along the land.By Glaucus’ spear the bold Iphinous bleedsFix’d in the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;Headlong he tumbles: his slack nerves unboundDrop the cold useless members on the ground.,ilias
When now Minerva saw her Argives slainFrom vast Olympus to the gleaming plainFierce she descends: Apollo marked her flightNor shot less swift from Ilion’s towery height.Radiant they met beneath the beechen shade;When thus Apollo to the blue-eyed maid:,ilias
“What cause O daughter of Almighty Jove!Thus wings thy progress from the realms above?Once more impetuous dost thou bend thy wayTo give to Greece the long divided day?Too much has Troy already felt thy hateNow breathe thy rage and hush the stern debate;This day the business of the field suspend;War soon shall kindle and great Ilion bend;Since vengeful goddesses confederate joinTo raze her walls though built by hands divine.”,ilias
To whom the progeny of Jove replies:“I left for this the council of the skies:But who shall bid conflicting hosts forbearWhat art shall calm the furious sons of war?”To her the god: “Great Hector’s soul inciteTo dare the boldest Greek to single fightTill Greece provoked from all her numbers showA warrior worthy to be Hector’s foe.”,ilias
At this agreed the heavenly powers withdrew;Sage Helenus their secret counsels knew;Hector inspired he sought: to him address’dThus told the dictates of his sacred breast:“O son of Priam! let thy faithful earReceive my words: thy friend and brother hear!Go forth persuasive and a while engageThe warring nations to suspend their rage;Then dare the boldest of the hostile trainTo mortal combat on the listed plain.For not this day shall end thy glorious date;The gods have spoke it and their voice is fate.”,ilias
He said: the warrior heard the word with joy;Then with his spear restrain’d the youth of TroyHeld by the midst athwart. On either handThe squadrons part; the expecting Trojans stand;Great Agamemnon bids the Greeks forbear:They breathe and hush the tumult of the war.The Athenian maid and glorious god of day178With silent joy the settling hosts survey:In form of vultures on the beech’s heightThey sit conceal’d and wait the future fight.,ilias
The thronging troops obscure the dusky fieldsHorrid with bristling spears and gleaming shields.As when a general darkness veils the main(Soft Zephyr curling the wide wat’ry plain)The waves scarce heave the face of ocean sleepsAnd a still horror saddens all the deeps;Thus in thick orders settling wide aroundAt length composed they sit and shade the ground.Great Hector first amidst both armies brokeThe solemn silence and their powers bespoke:,ilias
This fierce defiance Greece astonish’d heardBlush’d to refuse and to accept it fear’d.Stern Menelaus first the silence brokeAnd inly groaning thus opprobrious spoke:,ilias
“Women of Greece! O scandal of your raceWhose coward souls your manly form disgraceHow great the shame when every age shall knowThat not a Grecian met this noble foe!Go then! resolve to earth from whence ye grewA heartless spiritless inglorious crew!Be what ye seem unanimated clayMyself will dare the danger of the day;’Tis man’s bold task the generous strife to tryBut in the hands of God is victory.”,ilias
These words scarce spoke with generous ardour press’dHis manly limbs in azure arms he dress’d.That day Atrides! a superior handHad stretch’d thee breathless on the hostile strand;But all at once thy fury to composeThe kings of Greece an awful band arose;Even he their chief great Agamemnon press’dThy daring hand and this advice address’d:“Whither O Menelaus! wouldst thou runAnd tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun?Grieved though thou art forbear the rash design;Great Hector’s arm is mightier far than thine:Even fierce Achilles learn’d its force to fearAnd trembling met this dreadful son of war.Sit thou secure amidst thy social band;Greece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand.The mightiest warrior of the Achaian nameThough bold and burning with desire of fameContent the doubtful honour might foregoSo great the danger and so brave the foe.”,ilias
He said and turn’d his brother’s vengeful mind;He stoop’d to reason and his rage resign’dNo longer bent to rush on certain harms;His joyful friends unbrace his azure arms.,ilias
His warm reproofs the listening kings inflame;And nine the noblest of the Grecian nameUp-started fierce: but far before the restThe king of men advanced his dauntless breast:Then bold Tydides great in arms appear’d;And next his bulk gigantic Ajax rear’d;Oileus follow’d; Idomen was there180And Merion dreadful as the god of war:With these Eurypylus and Thoas standAnd wise Ulysses closed the daring band.All these alike inspired with noble rageDemand the fight. To whom the Pylian sage:,ilias
“Lest thirst of glory your brave souls divideWhat chief shall combat let the gods decide.Whom heaven shall choose be his the chance to raiseHis country’s fame his own immortal praise.”,ilias
The lots produced each hero signs his own:Then in the general’s helm the fates are thrown181The people pray with lifted eyes and handsAnd vows like these ascend from all the bands:“Grant thou Almighty! in whose hand is fateA worthy champion for the Grecian state:This task let Ajax or Tydides proveOr he the king of kings beloved by Jove.”Old Nestor shook the casque. By heaven inspiredLeap’d forth the lot of every Greek desired.This from the right to left the herald bearsHeld out in order to the Grecian peers;Each to his rival yields the mark unknownTill godlike Ajax finds the lot his own;Surveys the inscription with rejoicing eyesThen casts before him and with transport cries:,ilias
“Warriors! I claim the lot and arm with joy;Be mine the conquest of this chief of Troy.Now while my brightest arms my limbs investTo Saturn’s son be all your vows address’d:But pray in secret lest the foes should hearAnd deem your prayers the mean effect of fear.Said I in secret? No your vows declareIn such a voice as fills the earth and airLives there a chief whom Ajax ought to dread?Ajax in all the toils of battle bred!From warlike Salamis I drew my birthAnd born to combats fear no force on earth.”,ilias
He said. The troops with elevated eyesImplore the god whose thunder rends the skies:“O father of mankind superior lord!On lofty Ida’s holy hill adored:Who in the highest heaven hast fix’d thy throneSupreme of gods! unbounded and alone:Grant thou that Telamon may bear awayThe praise and conquest of this doubtful day;Or if illustrious Hector be thy careThat both may claim it and that both may share.”,ilias
Now Ajax braced his dazzling armour on;Sheathed in bright steel the giant-warrior shone:He moves to combat with majestic pace;So stalks in arms the grisly god of Thrace182When Jove to punish faithless men preparesAnd gives whole nations to the waste of warsThus march’d the chief tremendous as a god;Grimly he smiled; earth trembled as he strode:183His massy javelin quivering in his handHe stood the bulwark of the Grecian band.Through every Argive heart new transport ran;All Troy stood trembling at the mighty man:Even Hector paused; and with new doubt oppress’dFelt his great heart suspended in his breast:’Twas vain to seek retreat and vain to fear;Himself had challenged and the foe drew near.,ilias
Stern Telamon behind his ample shieldAs from a brazen tower o’erlook’d the field.Huge was its orb with seven thick folds o’ercastOf tough bull-hides; of solid brass the last(The work of Tychius who in Hyle dwell’dAnd in all arts of armoury excell’d)This Ajax bore before his manly breastAnd threatening thus his adverse chief address’d:,ilias
“Hector! approach my arm and singly knowWhat strength thou hast and what the Grecian foe.Achilles shuns the fight; yet some there areNot void of soul and not unskill’d in war:Let him unactive on the sea-beat shoreIndulge his wrath and aid our arms no more;Whole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boastAnd sends thee one a sample of her hostSuch as I am I come to prove thy might;No more—be sudden and begin the fight.”,ilias
“O son of Telamon thy country’s pride!(To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied)Me as a boy or woman wouldst thou frightNew to the field and trembling at the fight?Thou meet’st a chief deserving of thy armsTo combat born and bred amidst alarms:I know to shift my ground remount the carTurn charge and answer every call of war;To right to left the dexterous lance I wieldAnd bear thick battle on my sounding shield/But open be our fight and bold each blow;I steal no conquest from a noble foe.”,ilias
“Forbear my sons! your further force to proveBoth dear to men and both beloved of Jove.To either host your matchless worth is knownEach sounds your praise and war is all your own.But now the Night extends her awful shade;The goddess parts you; be the night obey’d.”184,ilias
To whom great Ajax his high soul express’d:“O sage! to Hector be these words address’d.Let him who first provoked our chiefs to fightLet him demand the sanction of the night;If first he ask’d it I content obeyAnd cease the strife when Hector shows the way.”,ilias
“O first of Greeks! (his noble foe rejoin’d)Whom heaven adorns superior to thy kindWith strength of body and with worth of mind!Now martial law commands us to forbear;Hereafter we shall meet in glorious warSome future day shall lengthen out the strifeAnd let the gods decide of death or life!Since then the night extends her gloomy shadeAnd heaven enjoins it be the night obey’d.Return brave Ajax to thy Grecian friendsAnd joy the nations whom thy arm defends;As I shall glad each chief and Trojan wifeWho wearies heaven with vows for Hector’s life.But let us on this memorable dayExchange some gift: that Greece and Troy may say‘Not hate but glory made these chiefs contend;And each brave foe was in his soul a friend.’”,ilias
With that a sword with stars of silver gracedThe baldric studded and the sheath enchasedHe gave the Greek. The generous Greek bestow’dA radiant belt that rich with purple glow’d.Then with majestic grace they quit the plain;This seeks the Grecian that the Phrygian train.,ilias
The Trojan bands returning Hector waitAnd hail with joy the Champion of their state;Escaped great Ajax they survey him roundAlive unarm’d and vigorous from his wound;To Troy’s high gates the godlike man they bearTheir present triumph as their late despair.,ilias
But Ajax glorying in his hardy deedThe well-arm’d Greeks to Agamemnon lead.A steer for sacrifice the king design’dOf full five years and of the nobler kind.The victim falls; they strip the smoking hideThe beast they quarter and the joints divide;Then spread the tables the repast prepareEach takes his seat and each receives his share.The king himself (an honorary sign)Before great Ajax placed the mighty chine.185When now the rage of hunger was removedNestor in each persuasive art approvedThe sage whose counsels long had sway’d the restIn words like these his prudent thought express’d:,ilias
“How dear O kings! this fatal day has costWhat Greeks are perish’d! what a people lost!What tides of blood have drench’d Scamander’s shore!What crowds of heroes sunk to rise no more!Then hear me chief! nor let the morrow’s lightAwake thy squadrons to new toils of fight:Some space at least permit the war to breatheWhile we to flames our slaughter’d friends bequeathFrom the red field their scatter’d bodies bearAnd nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear;So decent urns their snowy bones may keepAnd pious children o’er their ashes weep.Here where on one promiscuous pile they blazedHigh o’er them all a general tomb be raised;Next to secure our camp and naval powersRaise an embattled wall with lofty towers;From space to space be ample gates aroundFor passing chariots; and a trench profound.So Greece to combat shall in safety goNor fear the fierce incursions of the foe.”’Twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel moved;The sceptred kings of Greece his words approved.,ilias
Meanwhile convened at Priam’s palace-gateThe Trojan peers in nightly council sate;A senate void of order as of choice:Their hearts were fearful and confused their voice.Antenor rising thus demands their ear:“Ye Trojans Dardans and auxiliars hear!’Tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspiresAnd I but move what every god requires:Let Sparta’s treasures be this hour restoredAnd Argive Helen own her ancient lord.The ties of faith the sworn alliance brokeOur impious battles the just gods provoke.As this advice ye practise or rejectSo hope success or dread the dire effect.”,ilias
The senior spoke and sate. To whom repliedThe graceful husband of the Spartan bride:“Cold counsels Trojan may become thy yearsBut sound ungrateful in a warrior’s ears:Old man if void of fallacy or artThy words express the purpose of thy heartThou in thy time more sound advice hast given;But wisdom has its date assign’d by heaven.Then hear me princes of the Trojan name!Their treasures I’ll restore but not the dame;My treasures too for peace I will resign;But be this bright possession ever mine.”,ilias
’Twas then the growing discord to composeSlow from his seat the reverend Priam rose:His godlike aspect deep attention drew:He paused and these pacific words ensue:,ilias
“Ye Trojans Dardans and auxiliar bands!Now take refreshment as the hour demands;Guard well the walls relieve the watch of night.Till the new sun restores the cheerful light.Then shall our herald to the Atrides sentBefore their ships proclaim my son’s intent.Next let a truce be ask’d that Troy may burnHer slaughter’d heroes and their bones inurn;That done once more the fate of war be triedAnd whose the conquest mighty Jove decide!”,ilias
The monarch spoke: the warriors snatch’d with haste(Each at his post in arms) a short repast.Soon as the rosy morn had waked the dayTo the black ships Idaeus bent his way;There to the sons of Mars in council foundHe raised his voice: the host stood listening round.,ilias
“Ye sons of Atreus and ye Greeks give ear!The words of Troy and Troy’s great monarch hear.Pleased may ye hear (so heaven succeed my prayers)What Paris author of the war declares.The spoils and treasures he to Ilion bore(Oh had he perish’d ere they touch’d our shore!)He proffers injured Greece: with large increaseOf added Trojan wealth to buy the peace.But to restore the beauteous bride againThis Greece demands and Troy requests in vain.Next O ye chiefs! we ask a truce to burnOur slaughter’d heroes and their bones inurn.That done once more the fate of war be triedAnd whose the conquest mighty Jove decide!”,ilias
The Greeks gave ear but none the silence broke;At length Tydides rose and rising spoke:“Oh take not friends! defrauded of your fameTheir proffer’d wealth nor even the Spartan dame.Let conquest make them ours: fate shakes their wallAnd Troy already totters to her fall.”,ilias
The admiring chiefs and all the Grecian nameWith general shouts return’d him loud acclaim.Then thus the king of kings rejects the peace:“Herald! in him thou hear’st the voice of GreeceFor what remains; let funeral flames be fedWith heroes’ corps: I war not with the dead:Go search your slaughtered chiefs on yonder plainAnd gratify the manes of the slain.Be witness Jove whose thunder rolls on high!”He said and rear’d his sceptre to the sky.,ilias
So toil’d the Greeks: meanwhile the gods aboveIn shining circle round their father JoveAmazed beheld the wondrous works of man:Then he whose trident shakes the earth began:,ilias
“What mortals henceforth shall our power adoreOur fanes frequent our oracles imploreIf the proud Grecians thus successful boastTheir rising bulwarks on the sea-beat coast?See the long walls extending to the mainNo god consulted and no victim slain!Their fame shall fill the world’s remotest endsWide as the morn her golden beam extends;While old Laomedon’s divine abodesThose radiant structures raised by labouring godsShall razed and lost in long oblivion sleep.”Thus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep.,ilias
The almighty Thunderer with a frown repliesThat clouds the world and blackens half the skies:“Strong god of ocean! thou whose rage can makeThe solid earth’s eternal basis shake!What cause of fear from mortal works could move187The meanest subject of our realms above?Where’er the sun’s refulgent rays are castThy power is honour’d and thy fame shall last.But yon proud work no future age shall viewNo trace remain where once the glory grew.The sapp’d foundations by thy force shall fallAnd whelm’d beneath the waves drop the huge wall:Vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore:The ruin vanish’d and the name no more.”,ilias
The time of seven and twenty days is employed from the opening of thepoem to the end of this book. The scene here (except of the celestialmachines) lies in the field towards the seashore.,ilias
Aurora now fair daughter of the dawnSprinkled with rosy light the dewy lawn;When Jove convened the senate of the skiesWhere high Olympus’ cloudy tops ariseThe sire of gods his awful silence broke;The heavens attentive trembled as he spoke:,ilias
The all-mighty spoke nor durst the powers reply:A reverend horror silenced all the sky;Trembling they stood before their sovereign’s look;At length his best-beloved the power of wisdom spoke:,ilias
“O first and greatest! God by gods adoredWe own thy might our father and our lord!But ah! permit to pity human state:If not to help at least lament their fate.From fields forbidden we submiss refrainWith arms unaiding mourn our Argives slain;Yet grant my counsels still their breasts may moveOr all must perish in the wrath of Jove.”,ilias
The cloud-compelling god her suit approvedAnd smiled superior on his best beloved;Then call’d his coursers and his chariot took;The stedfast firmament beneath them shook:Rapt by the ethereal steeds the chariot roll’d;Brass were their hoofs their curling manes of gold:Of heaven’s undrossy gold the gods arrayRefulgent flash’d intolerable day.High on the throne he shines: his coursers flyBetween the extended earth and starry sky.But when to Ida’s topmost height he came(Fair nurse of fountains and of savage game)Where o’er her pointed summits proudly raisedHis fane breathed odours and his altar blazed:There from his radiant car the sacred sireOf gods and men released the steeds of fire:Blue ambient mists the immortal steeds embraced;High on the cloudy point his seat he placed;Thence his broad eye the subject world surveysThe town and tents and navigable seas.,ilias
“Whither oh whither does Ulysses run?Oh flight unworthy great Laertes’ son!Mix’d with the vulgar shall thy fate be foundPierced in the back a vile dishonest wound?Oh turn and save from Hector’s direful rageThe glory of the Greeks the Pylian sage.”His fruitless words are lost unheard in airUlysses seeks the ships and shelters there.But bold Tydides to the rescue goesA single warrior midst a host of foes;Before the coursers with a sudden springHe leap’d and anxious thus bespoke the king:,ilias
“Great perils father! wait the unequal fight;These younger champions will oppress thy might.Thy veins no more with ancient vigour glowWeak is thy servant and thy coursers slow.Then haste ascend my seat and from the carObserve the steeds of Tros renown’d in war.Practised alike to turn to stop to chaseTo dare the fight or urge the rapid race:These late obey’d Æneas’ guiding rein;Leave thou thy chariot to our faithful train;With these against yon Trojans will we goNor shall great Hector want an equal foe;Fierce as he is even he may learn to fearThe thirsty fury of my flying spear.”,ilias
“O chief! too daring in thy friend’s defenceRetire advised and urge the chariot hence.This day averse the sovereign of the skiesAssists great Hector and our palm denies.Some other sun may see the happier hourWhen Greece shall conquer by his heavenly power.’Tis not in man his fix’d decree to move:The great will glory to submit to Jove.”,ilias
Now fears dissuade him and now hopes invite.To stop his coursers and to stand the fight;Thrice turn’d the chief and thrice imperial JoveOn Ida’s summits thunder’d from above.Great Hector heard; he saw the flashing light(The sign of conquest) and thus urged the fight:,ilias
“Hear every Trojan Lycian Dardan bandAll famed in war and dreadful hand to hand.Be mindful of the wreaths your arms have wonYour great forefathers’ glories and your own.Heard ye the voice of Jove? Success and fameAwait on Troy on Greece eternal shame.In vain they skulk behind their boasted wallWeak bulwarks; destined by this arm to fall.High o’er their slighted trench our steeds shall boundAnd pass victorious o’er the levell’d mound.Soon as before yon hollow ships we standFight each with flames and toss the blazing brand;Till their proud navy wrapt in smoke and firesAll Greece encompass’d in one blaze expires.”,ilias
“Now Xanthus Æthon Lampus urge the chaseAnd thou Podargus! prove thy generous race;Be fleet be fearless this important dayAnd all your master’s well-spent care repay.For this high-fed in plenteous stalls ye standServed with pure wheat and by a princess’ hand;For this my spouse of great Aetion’s lineSo oft has steep’d the strengthening grain in wine.Now swift pursue now thunder uncontroll’d:Give me to seize rich Nestor’s shield of gold;From Tydeus’ shoulders strip the costly loadVulcanian arms the labour of a god:These if we gain then victory ye powers!This night this glorious night the fleet is ours!”,ilias
That heard deep anguish stung Saturnia’s soul;She shook her throne that shook the starry pole:And thus to Neptune: “Thou whose force can makeThe stedfast earth from her foundations shakeSeest thou the Greeks by fates unjust oppress’dNor swells thy heart in that immortal breast?Yet Ægae Helice thy power obey195And gifts unceasing on thine altars lay.Would all the deities of Greece combineIn vain the gloomy Thunderer might repine:Sole should he sit with scarce a god to friendAnd see his Trojans to the shades descend:Such be the scene from his Idaean bower;Ungrateful prospect to the sullen power!”,ilias
Neptune with wrath rejects the rash design:“What rage what madness furious queen! is thine?I war not with the highest. All aboveSubmit and tremble at the hand of Jove.”,ilias
To this the chief: “With praise the rest inspireNor urge a soul already fill’d with fire.What strength I have be now in battle triedTill every shaft in Phrygian blood be dyed.Since rallying from our wall we forced the foeStill aim’d at Hector have I bent my bow:Eight forky arrows from this hand have fledAnd eight bold heroes by their points lie dead:But sure some god denies me to destroyThis fury of the field this dog of Troy.”,ilias
“O daughter of that god whose arm can wieldThe avenging bolt and shake the sable shield!Now in this moment of her last despairShall wretched Greece no more confess our careCondemn’d to suffer the full force of fateAnd drain the dregs of heaven’s relentless hate?Gods! shall one raging hand thus level all?What numbers fell! what numbers yet shall fall!What power divine shall Hector’s wrath assuage?Still swells the slaughter and still grows the rage!”,ilias
She ceased and Juno rein’d the steeds with care:(Heaven’s awful empress Saturn’s other heir:)Pallas meanwhile her various veil unboundWith flowers adorn’d with art immortal crown’d;The radiant robe her sacred fingers woveFloats in rich waves and spreads the court of Jove.Her father’s arms her mighty limbs investHis cuirass blazes on her ample breast.The vigorous power the trembling car ascends:Shook by her arm the massy javelin bends:Huge ponderous strong! that when her fury burnsProud tyrants humbles and whole hosts o’erturns.,ilias
Saturnia lends the lash; the coursers fly;Smooth glides the chariot through the liquid sky.Heaven’s gates spontaneous open to the powersHeaven’s golden gates kept by the winged Hours.Commission’d in alternate watch they standThe sun’s bright portals and the skies command;Close or unfold the eternal gates of dayBar heaven with clouds or roll those clouds away.The sounding hinges ring the clouds divide.Prone down the steep of heaven their course they guide.But Jove incensed from Ida’s top survey’dAnd thus enjoin’d the many-colour’d maid.,ilias
“Thaumantia! mount the winds and stop their car;Against the highest who shall wage the war?If furious yet they dare the vain debateThus have I spoke and what I speak is fate:Their coursers crush’d beneath the wheels shall lieTheir car in fragments scatter’d o’er the sky:My lightning these rebellious shall confoundAnd hurl them flaming headlong to the groundCondemn’d for ten revolving years to weepThe wounds impress’d by burning thunder deep.So shall Minerva learn to fear our ireNor dare to combat hers and nature’s sire.For Juno headstrong and imperious stillShe claims some title to transgress our will.”,ilias
Swift as the wind the various-colour’d maidFrom Ida’s top her golden wings display’d;To great Olympus’ shining gate she fliesThere meets the chariot rushing down the skiesRestrains their progress from the bright abodesAnd speaks the mandate of the sire of gods.,ilias
“What frenzy goddesses! what rage can moveCelestial minds to tempt the wrath of Jove?Desist obedient to his high command:This is his word; and know his word shall stand:His lightning your rebellion shall confoundAnd hurl ye headlong flaming to the ground;Your horses crush’d beneath the wheels shall lieYour car in fragments scatter’d o’er the sky;Yourselves condemn’d ten rolling years to weepThe wounds impress’d by burning thunder deep.So shall Minerva learn to fear his ireNor dare to combat hers and nature’s sire.For Juno headstrong and imperious stillShe claims some title to transgress his will:But thee what desperate insolence has drivenTo lift thy lance against the king of heaven?”,ilias
“O daughter of that god whose arm can wieldThe avenging bolt and shake the saber shield!No more let beings of superior birthContend with Jove for this low race of earth;Triumphant now now miserably slainThey breathe or perish as the fates ordain:But Jove’s high counsels full effect shall find;And ever constant ever rule mankind.”,ilias
She spoke and backward turn’d her steeds of lightAdorn’d with manes of gold and heavenly bright.The Hours unloosed them panting as they stoodAnd heap’d their mangers with ambrosial food.There tied they rest in high celestial stalls;The chariot propp’d against the crystal wallsThe pensive goddesses abash’d controll’dMix with the gods and fill their seats of gold.,ilias
Juno and Pallas grieving hear the doomBut feast their souls on Ilion’s woes to come.Though secret anger swell’d Minerva’s breastThe prudent goddess yet her wrath repress’d;But Juno impotent of rage replies:“What hast thou said O tyrant of the skies!Strength and omnipotence invest thy throne;’Tis thine to punish; ours to grieve alone.For Greece we grieve abandon’d by her fateTo drink the dregs of thy unmeasured hate.From fields forbidden we submiss refrainWith arms unaiding see our Argives slain;Yet grant our counsels still their breasts may moveLest all should perish in the rage of Jove.”,ilias
“The morning sun awaked by loud alarmsShall see the almighty Thunderer in arms.What heaps of Argives then shall load the plainThose radiant eyes shall view and view in vain.Nor shall great Hector cease the rage of fightThe navy flaming and thy Greeks in flightEven till the day when certain fates ordainThat stern Achilles (his Patroclus slain)Shall rise in vengeance and lay waste the plain.For such is fate nor canst thou turn its courseWith all thy rage with all thy rebel force.Fly if thy wilt to earth’s remotest boundWhere on her utmost verge the seas resound;Where cursed Iapetus and Saturn dwellFast by the brink within the streams of hell;No sun e’er gilds the gloomy horrors there;No cheerful gales refresh the lazy air:There arm once more the bold Titanian band;And arm in vain; for what I will shall stand.”,ilias
Now deep in ocean sunk the lamp of lightAnd drew behind the cloudy veil of night:The conquering Trojans mourn his beams decay’d;The Greeks rejoicing bless the friendly shade.,ilias
The victors keep the field; and Hector callsA martial council near the navy walls;These to Scamander’s bank apart he ledWhere thinly scatter’d lay the heaps of dead.The assembled chiefs descending on the groundAttend his order and their prince surround.A massy spear he bore of mighty strengthOf full ten cubits was the lance’s length;The point was brass refulgent to beholdFix’d to the wood with circling rings of gold:The noble Hector on his lance reclinedAnd bending forward thus reveal’d his mind:,ilias
The leader spoke. From all his host aroundShouts of applause along the shores resound.Each from the yoke the smoking steeds untiedAnd fix’d their headstalls to his chariot-side.Fat sheep and oxen from the town are ledWith generous wine and all-sustaining breadFull hecatombs lay burning on the shore:The winds to heaven the curling vapours bore.Ungrateful offering to the immortal powers!197Whose wrath hung heavy o’er the Trojan towers:Nor Priam nor his sons obtain’d their grace;Proud Troy they hated and her guilty race.,ilias
Agamemnon after the last day’s defeat proposes to the Greeks to quitthe siege and return to their country. Diomed opposes this and Nestorseconds him praising his wisdom and resolution. He orders the guard tobe strengthened and a council summoned to deliberate what measures areto be followed in this emergency. Agamemnon pursues this advice andNestor further prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles inorder to move him to a reconciliation. Ulysses and Ajax are made choiceof who are accompanied by old Phoenix. They make each of them verymoving and pressing speeches but are rejected with roughness byAchilles who notwithstanding retains Phoenix in his tent. Theambassadors return unsuccessfully to the camp and the troops betakethemselves to sleep.,ilias
This book and the next following take up the space of one nightwhich is the twenty-seventh from the beginning of the poem. The scenelies on the sea-shore the station of the Grecian ships.,ilias
Thus joyful Troy maintain’d the watch of night;While fear pale comrade of inglorious flight199And heaven-bred horror on the Grecian partSat on each face and sadden’d every heart.As from its cloudy dungeon issuing forthA double tempest of the west and northSwells o’er the sea from Thracia’s frozen shoreHeaps waves on waves and bids the Ægean roar:This way and that the boiling deeps are toss’d:Such various passions urged the troubled hostGreat Agamemnon grieved above the rest;Superior sorrows swell’d his royal breast;Himself his orders to the heralds bearsTo bid to council all the Grecian peersBut bid in whispers: these surround their chiefIn solemn sadness and majestic grief.The king amidst the mournful circle rose:Down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows.So silent fountains from a rock’s tall headIn sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.With more than vulgar grief he stood oppress’d;Words mix’d with sighs thus bursting from his breast:,ilias
“Ye sons of Greece! partake your leader’s care;Fellows in arms and princes of the war!Of partial Jove too justly we complainAnd heavenly oracles believed in vain.A safe return was promised to our toilsWith conquest honour’d and enrich’d with spoils:Now shameful flight alone can save the host;Our wealth our people and our glory lost.So Jove decrees almighty lord of all!Jove at whose nod whole empires rise or fallWho shakes the feeble props of human trustAnd towers and armies humbles to the dust.Haste then for ever quit these fatal fieldsHaste to the joys our native country yields;Spread all your canvas all your oars employNor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy.”,ilias
He ceased; the Greeks loud acclamations raiseAnd voice to voice resounds Tydides’ praise.Wise Nestor then his reverend figure rear’d;He spoke: the host in still attention heard:200,ilias
“O truly great! in whom the gods have join’dSuch strength of body with such force of mind:In conduct as in courage you excelStill first to act what you advise so well.These wholesome counsels which thy wisdom movesApplauding Greece with common voice approves.Kings thou canst blame; a bold but prudent youth:And blame even kings with praise because with truth.And yet those years that since thy birth have runWould hardly style thee Nestor’s youngest son.Then let me add what yet remains behindA thought unfinish’d in that generous mind;Age bids me speak! nor shall the advice I bringDistaste the people or offend the king:,ilias
“Cursed is the man and void of law and rightUnworthy property unworthy lightUnfit for public rule or private careThat wretch that monster who delights in war;Whose lust is murder and whose horrid joyTo tear his country and his kind destroy!This night refresh and fortify thy train;Between the trench and wall let guards remain:Be that the duty of the young and bold;But thou O king to council call the old;Great is thy sway and weighty are thy cares;Thy high commands must spirit all our wars.With Thracian wines recruit thy honour’d guestsFor happy counsels flow from sober feasts.Wise weighty counsels aid a state distress’dAnd such a monarch as can choose the best.See what a blaze from hostile tents aspiresHow near our fleet approach the Trojan fires!Who can unmoved behold the dreadful light?What eye beholds them and can close to-night?This dreadful interval determines all;To-morrow Troy must flame or Greece must fall.”,ilias
Thus spoke the hoary sage: the rest obey;Swift through the gates the guards direct their way.His son was first to pass the lofty moundThe generous Thrasymed in arms renown’d:Next him Ascalaphus Ialmen stoodThe double offspring of the warrior-god:Deipyrus Aphareus Merion joinAnd Lycomed of Creon’s noble line.Seven were the leaders of the nightly bandsAnd each bold chief a hundred spears commands.The fires they light to short repasts they fallSome line the trench and others man the wall.,ilias
The king of men on public counsels bentConvened the princes in his ample tentEach seized a portion of the kingly feastBut stay’d his hand when thirst and hunger ceased.Then Nestor spoke for wisdom long approvedAnd slowly rising thus the council moved.,ilias
“Monarch of nations! whose superior swayAssembled states and lords of earth obeyThe laws and sceptres to thy hand are givenAnd millions own the care of thee and Heaven.O king! the counsels of my age attend;With thee my cares begin with thee must end.Thee prince! it fits alike to speak and hearPronounce with judgment with regard give earTo see no wholesome motion be withstoodAnd ratify the best for public good.Nor though a meaner give advice repineBut follow it and make the wisdom thine.Hear then a thought not now conceived in hasteAt once my present judgment and my past.When from Pelides’ tent you forced the maidI first opposed and faithful durst dissuade;But bold of soul when headlong fury firedYou wronged the man by men and gods admired:Now seek some means his fatal wrath to endWith prayers to move him or with gifts to bend.”,ilias
The monarch thus. The reverend Nestor then:“Great Agamemnon! glorious king of men!Such are thy offers as a prince may takeAnd such as fits a generous king to make.Let chosen delegates this hour be sent(Myself will name them) to Pelides’ tent.Let Phoenix lead revered for hoary ageGreat Ajax next and Ithacus the sage.Yet more to sanctify the word you sendLet Hodius and Eurybates attend.Now pray to Jove to grant what Greece demands;Pray in deep silence205 and with purest hands.”206,ilias
“Princes all hail! whatever brought you here.Or strong necessity or urgent fear;Welcome though Greeks! for not as foes ye came;To me more dear than all that bear the name.”,ilias
With that the chiefs beneath his roof he ledAnd placed in seats with purple carpets spread.Then thus—“Patroclus crown a larger bowlMix purer wine and open every soul.Of all the warriors yonder host can sendThy friend most honours these and these thy friend.”,ilias
Then thus the goddess-born: “Ulysses hearA faithful speech that knows nor art nor fear;What in my secret soul is understoodMy tongue shall utter and my deeds make good.Let Greece then know my purpose I retain:Nor with new treaties vex my peace in vain.Who dares think one thing and another tellMy heart detests him as the gates of hell.,ilias
The son of Peleus ceased: the chiefs aroundIn silence wrapt in consternation drown’dAttend the stern reply. Then Phoenix rose;(Down his white beard a stream of sorrow flows;)And while the fate of suffering Greece he mourn’dWith accent weak these tender words return’d.,ilias
“Where Calydon on rocky mountains stands212Once fought the Ætolian and Curetian bands;To guard it those; to conquer these advance;And mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance.The silver Cynthia bade contention riseIn vengeance of neglected sacrifice;On OEneus fields she sent a monstrous boarThat levell’d harvests and whole forests tore:This beast (when many a chief his tusks had slain)Great Meleager stretch’d along the plainThen for his spoils a new debate aroseThe neighbour nations thence commencing foes.Strong as they were the bold Curetes fail’dWhile Meleager’s thundering arm prevail’d:Till rage at length inflamed his lofty breast(For rage invades the wisest and the best).,ilias
Thus he: the stern Achilles thus replied:“My second father and my reverend guide:Thy friend believe me no such gifts demandsAnd asks no honours from a mortal’s hands;Jove honours me and favours my designs;His pleasure guides me and his will confines;And here I stay (if such his high behest)While life’s warm spirit beats within my breast.Yet hear one word and lodge it in thy heart:No more molest me on Atrides’ part:Is it for him these tears are taught to flowFor him these sorrows? for my mortal foe?A generous friendship no cold medium knowsBurns with one love with one resentment glows;One should our interests and our passions be;My friend must hate the man that injures me.Do this my Phoenix ’tis a generous part;And share my realms my honours and my heart.Let these return: our voyage or our stayRest undetermined till the dawning day.”,ilias
He ceased; then order’d for the sage’s bedA warmer couch with numerous carpets spread.With that stern Ajax his long silence brokeAnd thus impatient to Ulysses spoke:,ilias
“Hence let us go—why waste we time in vain?See what effect our low submissions gain!Liked or not liked his words we must relateThe Greeks expect them and our heroes wait.Proud as he is that iron heart retainsIts stubborn purpose and his friends disdains.Stern and unpitying! if a brother bleedOn just atonement we remit the deed;A sire the slaughter of his son forgives;The price of blood discharged the murderer lives:The haughtiest hearts at length their rage resignAnd gifts can conquer every soul but thine.213The gods that unrelenting breast have steel’dAnd cursed thee with a mind that cannot yield.One woman-slave was ravish’d from thy arms:Lo seven are offer’d and of equal charms.Then hear Achilles! be of better mind;Revere thy roof and to thy guests be kind;And know the men of all the Grecian hostWho honour worth and prize thy valour most.”,ilias
“O soul of battles and thy people’s guide!(To Ajax thus the first of Greeks replied)Well hast thou spoke; but at the tyrant’s nameMy rage rekindles and my soul’s on flame:’Tis just resentment and becomes the brave:Disgraced dishonour’d like the vilest slave!Return then heroes! and our answer bearThe glorious combat is no more my care;Not till amidst yon sinking navy slainThe blood of Greeks shall dye the sable main;Not till the flames by Hector’s fury thrownConsume your vessels and approach my own;Just there the impetuous homicide shall standThere cease his battle and there feel our hand.”,ilias
This said each prince a double goblet crown’dAnd cast a large libation on the ground;Then to their vessels through the gloomy shadesThe chiefs return; divine Ulysses leads.Meantime Achilles’ slaves prepared a bedWith fleeces carpets and soft linen spread:There till the sacred morn restored the dayIn slumber sweet the reverend Phoenix lay.But in his inner tent an ampler spaceAchilles slept; and in his warm embraceFair Diomede of the Lesbian race.Last for Patroclus was the couch preparedWhose nightly joys the beauteous Iphis shared;Achilles to his friend consign’d her charmsWhen Scyros fell before his conquering arms.,ilias
And now the elected chiefs whom Greece had sentPass’d through the hosts and reach’d the royal tent.Then rising all with goblets in their handsThe peers and leaders of the Achaian bandsHail’d their return: Atrides first begun:,ilias
“Say what success? divine Laertes’ son!Achilles’ high resolves declare to all:Returns the chief or must our navy fall?”,ilias
“Great king of nations! (Ithacus replied)Fix’d is his wrath unconquer’d is his pride;He slights thy friendship thy proposals scornsAnd thus implored with fiercer fury burns.To save our army and our fleets to freeIs not his care; but left to Greece and thee.Your eyes shall view when morning paints the skyBeneath his oars the whitening billows fly;Us too he bids our oars and sails employNor hope the fall of heaven-protected Troy;For Jove o’ershades her with his arm divineInspires her war and bids her glory shine.Such was his word: what further he declaredThese sacred heralds and great Ajax heard.But Phoenix in his tent the chief retainsSafe to transport him to his native plainsWhen morning dawns; if other he decreeHis age is sacred and his choice is free.”,ilias
Ulysses ceased: the great Achaian hostWith sorrow seized in consternation lostAttend the stern reply. Tydides brokeThe general silence and undaunted spoke.“Why should we gifts to proud Achilles sendOr strive with prayers his haughty soul to bend?His country’s woes he glories to derideAnd prayers will burst that swelling heart with pride.Be the fierce impulse of his rage obey’dOur battles let him or desert or aid;Then let him arm when Jove or he think fit:That to his madness or to Heaven commit:What for ourselves we can is always ours;This night let due repast refresh our powers;(For strength consists in spirits and in bloodAnd those are owed to generous wine and food;)But when the rosy messenger of dayStrikes the blue mountains with her golden rayRanged at the ships let all our squadrons shineIn flaming arms a long-extended line:In the dread front let great Atrides standThe first in danger as in high command.”,ilias
Shouts of acclaim the listening heroes raiseThen each to Heaven the due libations pays;Till sleep descending o’er the tents bestowsThe grateful blessings of desired repose.214,ilias
Upon the refusal of Achilles to return to the army the distress ofAgamemnon is described in the most lively manner. He takes no rest thatnight but passes through the camp awaking the leaders and contrivingall possible methods for the public safety. Menelaus Nestor Ulyssesand Diomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains. They calla council of war and determine to send scouts into the enemies’ campto learn their posture and discover their intentions. Diomedundertakes this hazardous enterprise and makes choice of Ulysses forhis companion. In their passage they surprise Dolon whom Hector hadsent on a like design to the camp of the Grecians. From him they areinformed of the situation of the Trojan and auxiliary forces andparticularly of Rhesus and the Thracians who were lately arrived. Theypass on with success; kill Rhesus with several of his officers andseize the famous horses of that prince with which they return intriumph to the camp.,ilias
All night the chiefs before their vessels layAnd lost in sleep the labours of the day:All but the king: with various thoughts oppress’d215His country’s cares lay rolling in his breast.As when by lightnings Jove’s ethereal powerForetels the rattling hail or weighty showerOr sends soft snows to whiten all the shoreOr bids the brazen throat of war to roar;By fits one flash succeeds as one expiresAnd heaven flames thick with momentary fires:So bursting frequent from Atrides’ breastSighs following sighs his inward fears confess’d.Now o’er the fields dejected he surveysFrom thousand Trojan fires the mounting blaze;Hears in the passing wind their music blowAnd marks distinct the voices of the foe.Now looking backwards to the fleet and coastAnxious he sorrows for the endangered host.He rends his hair in sacrifice to JoveAnd sues to him that ever lives above:Inly he groans; while glory and despairDivide his heart and wage a double war.,ilias
To whom the king: “In such distress we standNo vulgar counsel our affairs demand;Greece to preserve is now no easy partBut asks high wisdom deep design and art.For Jove averse our humble prayer deniesAnd bows his head to Hector’s sacrifice.What eye has witness’d or what ear believedIn one great day by one great arm achievedSuch wondrous deeds as Hector’s hand has doneAnd we beheld the last revolving sun?What honours the beloved of Jove adorn!Sprung from no god and of no goddess born;Yet such his acts as Greeks unborn shall tellAnd curse the battle where their fathers fell.,ilias
“Now speed thy hasty course along the fleetThere call great Ajax and the prince of Crete;Ourself to hoary Nestor will repair;To keep the guards on duty be his care(For Nestor’s influence best that quarter guidesWhose son with Merion o’er the watch presides.”)To whom the Spartan: “These thy orders borneSay shall I stay or with despatch return?”“There shall thou stay (the king of men replied)Else may we miss to meet without a guideThe paths so many and the camp so wide.Still with your voice the slothful soldiers raiseUrge by their fathers’ fame their future praise.Forget we now our state and lofty birth;Not titles here but works must prove our worth.To labour is the lot of man below;And when Jove gave us life he gave us woe.”,ilias
This said each parted to his several cares:The king to Nestor’s sable ship repairs;The sage protector of the Greeks he foundStretch’d in his bed with all his arms around;The various-colour’d scarf the shield he rearsThe shining helmet and the pointed spears;The dreadful weapons of the warrior’s rageThat old in arms disdain’d the peace of age.Then leaning on his hand his watchful headThe hoary monarch raised his eyes and said:,ilias
“What art thou speak that on designs unknownWhile others sleep thus range the camp alone;Seek’st thou some friend or nightly sentinel?Stand off approach not but thy purpose tell.”,ilias
“O son of Neleus (thus the king rejoin’d)Pride of the Greeks and glory of thy kind!Lo here the wretched Agamemnon standsThe unhappy general of the Grecian bandsWhom Jove decrees with daily cares to bendAnd woes that only with his life shall end!Scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustainAnd scarce my heart support its load of pain.No taste of sleep these heavy eyes have knownConfused and sad I wander thus aloneWith fears distracted with no fix’d design;And all my people’s miseries are mine.If aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest(Since cares like mine deprive thy soul of rest)Impart thy counsel and assist thy friend;Now let us jointly to the trench descendAt every gate the fainting guard exciteTired with the toils of day and watch of night;Else may the sudden foe our works invadeSo near and favour’d by the gloomy shade.”,ilias
To him thus Nestor: “Trust the powers aboveNor think proud Hector’s hopes confirm’d by Jove:How ill agree the views of vain mankindAnd the wise counsels of the eternal mind!Audacious Hector if the gods ordainThat great Achilles rise and rage againWhat toils attend thee and what woes remain!Lo faithful Nestor thy command obeys;The care is next our other chiefs to raise:Ulysses Diomed we chiefly need;Meges for strength Oileus famed for speed.Some other be despatch’d of nimbler feetTo those tall ships remotest of the fleetWhere lie great Ajax and the king of Crete.216To rouse the Spartan I myself decree;Dear as he is to us and dear to theeYet must I tax his sloth that claims no shareWith his great brother in his martial care:Him it behoved to every chief to suePreventing every part perform’d by you;For strong necessity our toils demandsClaims all our hearts and urges all our hands.”,ilias
To whom the king: “With reverence we allowThy just rebukes yet learn to spare them now:My generous brother is of gentle kindHe seems remiss but bears a valiant mind;Through too much deference to our sovereign swayContent to follow when we lead the way:But now our ills industrious to preventLong ere the rest he rose and sought my tent.The chiefs you named already at his callPrepare to meet us near the navy-wall;Assembling there between the trench and gatesNear the night-guards our chosen council waits.”,ilias
“Rise son of Tydeus! to the brave and strongRest seems inglorious and the night too long.But sleep’st thou now when from yon hill the foeHangs o’er the fleet and shades our walls below?”,ilias
At this soft slumber from his eyelids fled;The warrior saw the hoary chief and said:“Wondrous old man! whose soul no respite knowsThough years and honours bid thee seek reposeLet younger Greeks our sleeping warriors wake;Ill fits thy age these toils to undertake.”“My friend (he answered) generous is thy care;These toils my subjects and my sons might bear;Their loyal thoughts and pious love conspireTo ease a sovereign and relieve a sire:But now the last despair surrounds our host;No hour must pass no moment must be lost;Each single Greek in this conclusive strifeStands on the sharpest edge of death or life:Yet if my years thy kind regard engageEmploy thy youth as I employ my age;Succeed to these my cares and rouse the rest;He serves me most who serves his country best.”,ilias
This said the hero o’er his shoulders flungA lion’s spoils that to his ankles hung;Then seized his ponderous lance and strode along.Meges the bold with Ajax famed for speedThe warrior roused and to the entrenchments lead.,ilias
“Is there (said he) a chief so greatly braveHis life to hazard and his country save?Lives there a man who singly dares to goTo yonder camp or seize some straggling foe?Or favour’d by the night approach so nearTheir speech their counsels and designs to hear?If to besiege our navies they prepareOr Troy once more must be the seat of war?This could he learn and to our peers reciteAnd pass unharm’d the dangers of the night;What fame were his through all succeeding daysWhile Phoebus shines or men have tongues to praise!What gifts his grateful country would bestow!What must not Greece to her deliverer owe?A sable ewe each leader should provideWith each a sable lambkin by her side;At every rite his share should be increasedAnd his the foremost honours of the feast.”,ilias
Fear held them mute: alone untaught to fearTydides spoke—“The man you seek is here.Through yon black camps to bend my dangerous waySome god within commands and I obey.But let some other chosen warrior joinTo raise my hopes and second my design.By mutual confidence and mutual aidGreat deeds are done and great discoveries made;The wise new prudence from the wise acquireAnd one brave hero fans another’s fire.”,ilias
Contending leaders at the word arose;Each generous breast with emulation glows;So brave a task each Ajax strove to shareBold Merion strove and Nestor’s valiant heir;The Spartan wish’d the second place to gainAnd great Ulysses wish’d nor wish’d in vain.Then thus the king of men the contest ends:“Thou first of warriors and thou best of friendsUndaunted Diomed! what chief to joinIn this great enterprise is only thine.Just be thy choice without affection made;To birth or office no respect be paid;Let worth determine here.” The monarch spakeAnd inly trembled for his brother’s sake.,ilias
“Then thus (the godlike Diomed rejoin’d)My choice declares the impulse of my mind.How can I doubt while great Ulysses standsTo lend his counsels and assist our hands?A chief whose safety is Minerva’s care;So famed so dreadful in the works of war:Bless’d in his conduct I no aid require;Wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire.”,ilias
“It fits thee not before these chiefs of fame(Replied the sage) to praise me or to blame:Praise from a friend or censure from a foeAre lost on hearers that our merits know.But let us haste—Night rolls the hours awayThe reddening orient shows the coming dayThe stars shine fainter on the ethereal plainsAnd of night’s empire but a third remains.”,ilias
“O daughter of that god whose arm can wieldThe avenging bolt and shake the saber shield!O thou! for ever present in my wayWho all my motions all my toils survey!Safe may we pass beneath the gloomy shadeSafe by thy succour to our ships convey’dAnd let some deed this signal night adornTo claim the tears of Trojans yet unborn.”,ilias
Then godlike Diomed preferr’d his prayer:“Daughter of Jove unconquer’d Pallas! hear.Great queen of arms whose favour Tydeus wonAs thou defend’st the sire defend the son.When on Æsopus’ banks the banded powersOf Greece he left and sought the Theban towersPeace was his charge; received with peaceful showHe went a legate but return’d a foe:Then help’d by thee and cover’d by thy shieldHe fought with numbers and made numbers yield.So now be present O celestial maid!So still continue to the race thine aid!A youthful steer shall fall beneath the strokeUntamed unconscious of the galling yokeWith ample forehead and with spreading hornsWhose taper tops refulgent gold adorns.”The heroes pray’d and Pallas from the skiesAccords their vow succeeds their enterprise.Now like two lions panting for the preyWith dreadful thoughts they trace the dreary wayThrough the black horrors of the ensanguined plainThrough dust through blood o’er arms and hills of slain.,ilias
Nor less bold Hector and the sons of TroyOn high designs the wakeful hours employ;The assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed;Who thus the counsels of his breast proposed:,ilias
“What glorious man for high attempts preparedDares greatly venture for a rich reward?Of yonder fleet a bold discovery makeWhat watch they keep and what resolves they take?If now subdued they meditate their flightAnd spent with toil neglect the watch of night?His be the chariot that shall please him mostOf all the plunder of the vanquish’d host;His the fair steeds that all the rest excelAnd his the glory to have served so well.”,ilias
A youth there was among the tribes of TroyDolon his name Eumedes’ only boy(Five girls beside the reverend herald told.)Rich was the son in brass and rich in gold;Not bless’d by nature with the charms of faceBut swift of foot and matchless in the race.“Hector! (he said) my courage bids me meetThis high achievement and explore the fleet:But first exalt thy sceptre to the skiesAnd swear to grant me the demanded prize;The immortal coursers and the glittering carThat bear Pelides through the ranks of war.Encouraged thus no idle scout I goFulfil thy wish their whole intention knowEven to the royal tent pursue my wayAnd all their counsels all their aims betray.”,ilias
The chief then heaved the golden sceptre highAttesting thus the monarch of the sky:“Be witness thou! immortal lord of all!Whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall:By none but Dolon shall this prize be borneAnd him alone the immortal steeds adorn.”,ilias
Thus Hector swore: the gods were call’d in vainBut the rash youth prepares to scour the plain:Across his back the bended bow he flungA wolf’s grey hide around his shoulders hungA ferret’s downy fur his helmet linedAnd in his hand a pointed javelin shined.Then (never to return) he sought the shoreAnd trod the path his feet must tread no more.Scarce had he pass’d the steeds and Trojan throng(Still bending forward as he coursed along)When on the hollow way the approaching treadUlysses mark’d and thus to Diomed;,ilias
“O friend! I hear some step of hostile feetMoving this way or hastening to the fleet;Some spy perhaps to lurk beside the main;Or nightly pillager that strips the slain.Yet let him pass and win a little space;Then rush behind him and prevent his pace.But if too swift of foot he flies beforeConfine his course along the fleet and shoreBetwixt the camp and him our spears employAnd intercept his hoped return to Troy.”,ilias
“O spare my youth and for the breath I oweLarge gifts of price my father shall bestow:Vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be toldAnd steel well-temper’d and refulgent gold.”,ilias
To whom Ulysses made this wise reply:“Whoe’er thou art be bold nor fear to die.What moves thee say when sleep has closed the sightTo roam the silent fields in dead of night?Cam’st thou the secrets of our camp to findBy Hector prompted or thy daring mind?Or art some wretch by hopes of plunder ledThrough heaps of carnage to despoil the dead?”,ilias
Then thus pale Dolon with a fearful look:(Still as he spoke his limbs with horror shook:)“Hither I came by Hector’s words deceived;Much did he promise rashly I believed:No less a bribe than great Achilles’ carAnd those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of warUrged me unwilling this attempt to make;To learn what counsels what resolves you take:If now subdued you fix your hopes on flightAnd tired with toils neglect the watch of night.”,ilias
“Bold was thy aim and glorious was the prize(Ulysses with a scornful smile replies)Far other rulers those proud steeds demandAnd scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand;Even great Achilles scarce their rage can tameAchilles sprung from an immortal dame.But say be faithful and the truth recite!Where lies encamp’d the Trojan chief to-night?Where stand his coursers? in what quarter sleepTheir other princes? tell what watch they keep:Say since this conquest what their counsels are;Or here to combat from their city farOr back to Ilion’s walls transfer the war?”,ilias
Ulysses thus and thus Eumedes’ son:“What Dolon knows his faithful tongue shall own.Hector the peers assembling in his tentA council holds at Ilus’ monument.No certain guards the nightly watch partake;Where’er yon fires ascend the Trojans wake:Anxious for Troy the guard the natives keep;Safe in their cares the auxiliar forces sleepWhose wives and infants from the danger farDischarge their souls of half the fears of war.”,ilias
“Then sleep those aids among the Trojan train(Inquired the chief) or scattered o’er the plain?”To whom the spy: “Their powers they thus disposeThe Paeons dreadful with their bended bowsThe Carians Caucons the Pelasgian hostAnd Leleges encamp along the coast.Not distant far lie higher on the landThe Lycian Mysian and Maeonian bandAnd Phrygia’s horse by Thymbras’ ancient wall;The Thracians utmost and apart from all.These Troy but lately to her succour wonLed on by Rhesus great Eioneus’ son:I saw his coursers in proud triumph goSwift as the wind and white as winter-snow;Rich silver plates his shining car infold;His solid arms refulgent flame with gold;No mortal shoulders suit the glorious loadCelestial panoply to grace a god!Let me unhappy to your fleet be borneOr leave me here a captive’s fate to mournIn cruel chains till your return revealThe truth or falsehood of the news I tell.”,ilias
To this Tydides with a gloomy frown:“Think not to live though all the truth be shown:Shall we dismiss thee in some future strifeTo risk more bravely thy now forfeit life?Or that again our camps thou may’st explore?No—once a traitor thou betray’st no more.”,ilias
Sternly he spoke and as the wretch preparedWith humble blandishment to stroke his beardLike lightning swift the wrathful falchion flewDivides the neck and cuts the nerves in two;One instant snatch’d his trembling soul to hellThe head yet speaking mutter’d as it fell.The furry helmet from his brow they tearThe wolf’s grey hide the unbended bow and spear;These great Ulysses lifting to the skiesTo favouring Pallas dedicates the prize:,ilias
“Great queen of arms receive this hostile spoilAnd let the Thracian steeds reward our toil;Thee first of all the heavenly host we praise;O speed our labours and direct our ways!”This said the spoils with dropping gore defacedHigh on a spreading tamarisk he placed;Then heap’d with reeds and gathered boughs the plainTo guide their footsteps to the place again.,ilias
Through the still night they cross the devious fieldsSlippery with blood o’er arms and heaps of shieldsArriving where the Thracian squadrons layAnd eased in sleep the labours of the day.Ranged in three lines they view the prostrate band:The horses yoked beside each warrior stand.Their arms in order on the ground reclinedThrough the brown shade the fulgid weapons shined:Amidst lay Rhesus stretch’d in sleep profoundAnd the white steeds behind his chariot bound.The welcome sight Ulysses first descriesAnd points to Diomed the tempting prize.“The man the coursers and the car behold!Described by Dolon with the arms of gold.Now brave Tydides! now thy courage tryApproach the chariot and the steeds untie;Or if thy soul aspire to fiercer deedsUrge thou the slaughter while I seize the steeds.”,ilias
Ulysses now the snowy steeds detainsAnd leads them fasten’d by the silver reins;These with his bow unbent he lash’d along;(The scourge forgot on Rhesus’ chariot hung;)Then gave his friend the signal to retire;But him new dangers new achievements fire;Doubtful he stood or with his reeking bladeTo send more heroes to the infernal shadeDrag off the car where Rhesus’ armour layOr heave with manly force and lift away.While unresolved the son of Tydeus standsPallas appears and thus her chief commands:,ilias
“Enough my son; from further slaughter ceaseRegard thy safety and depart in peace;Haste to the ships the gotten spoils enjoyNor tempt too far the hostile gods of Troy.”,ilias
The voice divine confess’d the martial maid;In haste he mounted and her word obey’d;The coursers fly before Ulysses’ bowSwift as the wind and white as winter-snow.,ilias
Not unobserved they pass’d: the god of lightHad watch’d his Troy and mark’d Minerva’s flightSaw Tydeus’ son with heavenly succour bless’dAnd vengeful anger fill’d his sacred breast.Swift to the Trojan camp descends the powerAnd wakes Hippocoon in the morning-hour;(On Rhesus’ side accustom’d to attendA faithful kinsman and instructive friend;)He rose and saw the field deform’d with bloodAn empty space where late the coursers stoodThe yet-warm Thracians panting on the coast;For each he wept but for his Rhesus most:Now while on Rhesus’ name he calls in vainThe gathering tumult spreads o’er all the plain;On heaps the Trojans rush with wild affrightAnd wondering view the slaughters of the night.,ilias
Meanwhile the chiefs arriving at the shadeWhere late the spoils of Hector’s spy were laidUlysses stopp’d; to him Tydides boreThe trophy dropping yet with Dolon’s gore:Then mounts again; again their nimbler feetThe coursers ply and thunder towards the fleet.,ilias
Old Nestor first perceived the approaching soundBespeaking thus the Grecian peers around:“Methinks the noise of trampling steeds I hearThickening this way and gathering on my ear;Perhaps some horses of the Trojan breed(So may ye gods! my pious hopes succeed)The great Tydides and Ulysses bearReturn’d triumphant with this prize of war.Yet much I fear (ah may that fear be vain!)The chiefs outnumber’d by the Trojan train;Perhaps even now pursued they seek the shore;Or oh! perhaps those heroes are no more.”,ilias
Scarce had he spoke when lo! the chiefs appearAnd spring to earth; the Greeks dismiss their fear:With words of friendship and extended handsThey greet the kings; and Nestor first demands:,ilias
“Say thou whose praises all our host proclaimThou living glory of the Grecian name!Say whence these coursers? by what chance bestow’dThe spoil of foes or present of a god?Not those fair steeds so radiant and so gayThat draw the burning chariot of the day.Old as I am to age I scorn to yieldAnd daily mingle in the martial field;But sure till now no coursers struck my sightLike these conspicuous through the ranks of fight.Some god I deem conferred the glorious prizeBless’d as ye are and favourites of the skies;The care of him who bids the thunder roarAnd her whose fury bathes the world with gore.”,ilias
“Father! not so (sage Ithacus rejoin’d)The gifts of heaven are of a nobler kind.Of Thracian lineage are the steeds ye viewWhose hostile king the brave Tydides slew;Sleeping he died with all his guards aroundAnd twelve beside lay gasping on the ground.These other spoils from conquer’d Dolon cameA wretch whose swiftness was his only fame;By Hector sent our forces to exploreHe now lies headless on the sandy shore.”,ilias
Then o’er the trench the bounding coursers flew;The joyful Greeks with loud acclaim pursue.Straight to Tydides’ high pavilion borneThe matchless steeds his ample stalls adorn:The neighing coursers their new fellows greetAnd the full racks are heap’d with generous wheat.But Dolon’s armour to his ships convey’dHigh on the painted stern Ulysses laidA trophy destin’d to the blue-eyed maid.,ilias
Now from nocturnal sweat and sanguine stainThey cleanse their bodies in the neighb’ring main:Then in the polished bath refresh’d from toilTheir joints they supple with dissolving oilIn due repast indulge the genial hourAnd first to Pallas the libations pour:They sit rejoicing in her aid divineAnd the crown’d goblet foams with floods of wine.,ilias
This book opens with the eight-and-twentieth day of the poem and thesame day with its various actions and adventures is extended throughthe twelfth thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth sixteenth seventeenthand part of the eighteenth books. The scene lies in the field near themonument of Ilus.,ilias
The saffron morn with early blushes spread219Now rose refulgent from Tithonus’ bed;With new-born day to gladden mortal sightAnd gild the courts of heaven with sacred light:When baleful Eris sent by Jove’s commandThe torch of discord blazing in her handThrough the red skies her bloody sign extendsAnd wrapt in tempests o’er the fleet descends.High on Ulysses’ bark her horrid standShe took and thunder’d through the seas and land.,ilias
Even Ajax and Achilles heard the soundWhose ships remote the guarded navy boundThence the black fury through the Grecian throngWith horror sounds the loud Orthian song:The navy shakes and at the dire alarmsEach bosom boils each warrior starts to arms.No more they sigh inglorious to returnBut breathe revenge and for the combat burn.,ilias
That instant Juno and the martial maidIn happy thunders promised Greece their aid;High o’er the chief they clash’d their arms in airAnd leaning from the clouds expect the war.,ilias
Close to the limits of the trench and moundThe fiery coursers to their chariots boundThe squires restrain’d: the foot with those who wieldThe lighter arms rush forward to the field.To second these in close array combinedThe squadrons spread their sable wings behind.Now shouts and tumults wake the tardy sunAs with the light the warriors’ toils begun.Even Jove whose thunder spoke his wrath distill’dRed drops of blood o’er all the fatal field;220The woes of men unwilling to surveyAnd all the slaughters that must stain the day.,ilias
Thus while the morning-beams increasing brightO’er heaven’s pure azure spread the glowing lightCommutual death the fate of war confoundsEach adverse battle gored with equal wounds.But now (what time in some sequester’d valeThe weary woodman spreads his sparing mealWhen his tired arms refuse the axe to rearAnd claim a respite from the sylvan war;But not till half the prostrate forests layStretch’d in long ruin and exposed to day)Then nor till then the Greeks’ impulsive mightPierced the black phalanx and let in the light.Great Agamemnon then the slaughter ledAnd slew Bienor at his people’s head:Whose squire Oileus with a sudden springLeap’d from the chariot to revenge his king;But in his front he felt the fatal woundWhich pierced his brain and stretch’d him on the ground.Atrides spoil’d and left them on the plain:Vain was their youth their glittering armour vain:Now soil’d with dust and naked to the skyTheir snowy limbs and beauteous bodies lie.,ilias
Amidst the tumult of the routed trainThe sons of false Antimachus were slain;He who for bribes his faithless counsels soldAnd voted Helen’s stay for Paris’ gold.Atrides mark’d as these their safety soughtAnd slew the children for the father’s fault;Their headstrong horse unable to restrainThey shook with fear and dropp’d the silken rein;Then in the chariot on their knees they fallAnd thus with lifted hands for mercy call:,ilias
“O spare our youth and for the life we oweAntimachus shall copious gifts bestow:Soon as he hears that not in battle slainThe Grecian ships his captive sons detainLarge heaps of brass in ransom shall be toldAnd steel well-tempered and persuasive gold.”,ilias
These words attended with the flood of tearsThe youths address’d to unrelenting ears:The vengeful monarch gave this stern reply:“If from Antimachus ye spring ye die;The daring wretch who once in council stoodTo shed Ulysses’ and my brother’s bloodFor proffer’d peace! and sues his seed for grace?No die and pay the forfeit of your race.”,ilias
Perhaps great Hector then had found his fateBut Jove and destiny prolong’d his date.Safe from the darts the care of heaven he stoodAmidst alarms and death and dust and blood.,ilias
Now past the tomb where ancient Ilus layThrough the mid field the routed urge their way:Where the wild figs the adjoining summit crownThe path they take and speed to reach the town.As swift Atrides with loud shouts pursuedHot with his toil and bathed in hostile blood.Now near the beech-tree and the Scaean gatesThe hero halts and his associates waits.Meanwhile on every side around the plainDispersed disorder’d fly the Trojan train.So flies a herd of beeves that hear dismay’dThe lion’s roaring through the midnight shade;On heaps they tumble with successless haste;The savage seizes draws and rends the last.Not with less fury stern Atrides flewStill press’d the rout and still the hindmost slew;Hurl’d from their cars the bravest chiefs are kill’dAnd rage and death and carnage load the field.,ilias
Now storms the victor at the Trojan wall;Surveys the towers and meditates their fall.But Jove descending shook the Idaean hillsAnd down their summits pour’d a hundred rills:The unkindled lightning in his hand he tookAnd thus the many-coloured maid bespoke:,ilias
“Iris with haste thy golden wings displayTo godlike Hector this our word convey—While Agamemnon wastes the ranks aroundFights in the front and bathes with blood the groundBid him give way; but issue forth commandsAnd trust the war to less important hands:But when or wounded by the spear or dartThat chief shall mount his chariot and departThen Jove shall string his arm and fire his breastThen to her ships shall flying Greece be press’dTill to the main the burning sun descendAnd sacred night her awful shade extend.”,ilias
He spoke and Iris at his word obey’d;On wings of winds descends the various maid.The chief she found amidst the ranks of warClose to the bulwarks on his glittering car.The goddess then: “O son of Priam hear!From Jove I come and his high mandate bear.While Agamemnon wastes the ranks aroundFights in the front and bathes with blood the groundAbstain from fight; yet issue forth commandsAnd trust the war to less important hands:But when or wounded by the spear or dartThe chief shall mount his chariot and departThen Jove shall string thy arm and fire thy breastThen to her ships shall flying Greece be press’dTill to the main the burning sun descendAnd sacred night her awful shade extend.”,ilias
She said and vanish’d. Hector with a boundSprings from his chariot on the trembling groundIn clanging arms: he grasps in either handA pointed lance and speeds from band to band;Revives their ardour turns their steps from flightAnd wakes anew the dying flames of fight.They stand to arms: the Greeks their onset dareCondense their powers and wait the coming war.New force new spirit to each breast returns;The fight renew’d with fiercer fury burns:The king leads on: all fix on him their eyeAnd learn from him to conquer or to die.,ilias
Coon Antenor’s eldest hope was nigh:Tears at the sight came starting from his eyeWhile pierced with grief the much-loved youth he view’dAnd the pale features now deform’d with blood.Then with his spear unseen his time he tookAim’d at the king and near his elbow strook.The thrilling steel transpierced the brawny partAnd through his arm stood forth the barbed dart.Surprised the monarch feels yet void of fearOn Coon rushes with his lifted spear:His brother’s corpse the pious Trojan drawsAnd calls his country to assert his cause;Defends him breathless on the sanguine fieldAnd o’er the body spreads his ample shield.Atrides marking an unguarded partTransfix’d the warrior with his brazen dart;Prone on his brother’s bleeding breast he layThe monarch’s falchion lopp’d his head away:The social shades the same dark journey goAnd join each other in the realms below.,ilias
The vengeful victor rages round the fieldsWith every weapon art or fury yields:By the long lance the sword or ponderous stoneWhole ranks are broken and whole troops o’erthrown.This while yet warm distill’d the purple flood;But when the wound grew stiff with clotted bloodThen grinding tortures his strong bosom rendLess keen those darts the fierce Ilythiae send:(The powers that cause the teeming matron’s throesSad mothers of unutterable woes!)Stung with the smart all-panting with the painHe mounts the car and gives his squire the rein;Then with a voice which fury made more strongAnd pain augmented thus exhorts the throng:,ilias
“O friends! O Greeks! assert your honours won;Proceed and finish what this arm begun:Lo! angry Jove forbids your chief to stayAnd envies half the glories of the day.”,ilias
He said: the driver whirls his lengthful thong;The horses fly; the chariot smokes along.Clouds from their nostrils the fierce coursers blowAnd from their sides the foam descends in snow;Shot through the battle in a moment’s spaceThe wounded monarch at his tent they place.,ilias
No sooner Hector saw the king retiredBut thus his Trojans and his aids he fired:“Hear all ye Dardan all ye Lycian race!Famed in close fight and dreadful face to face:Now call to mind your ancient trophies wonYour great forefathers’ virtues and your own.Behold the general flies! deserts his powers!Lo Jove himself declares the conquest ours!Now on yon ranks impel your foaming steeds;And sure of glory dare immortal deeds.”,ilias
“No martial toil I shun no danger fear;Let Hector come; I wait his fury here.But Jove with conquest crowns the Trojan train:And Jove our foe all human force is vain.”,ilias
He sigh’d; but sighing raised his vengeful steelAnd from his car the proud Thymbraeus fell:Molion the charioteer pursued his lordHis death ennobled by Ulysses’ sword.There slain they left them in eternal nightThen plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight.So two wild boars outstrip the following houndsThen swift revert and wounds return for wounds.Stern Hector’s conquests in the middle plainStood check’d awhile and Greece respired again.,ilias
Him while he triumph’d Paris eyed from far(The spouse of Helen the fair cause of war;)Around the fields his feather’d shafts he sentFrom ancient Ilus’ ruin’d monument:Behind the column placed he bent his bowAnd wing’d an arrow at the unwary foe;Just as he stoop’d Agastrophus’s crestTo seize and drew the corslet from his breastThe bowstring twang’d; nor flew the shaft in vainBut pierced his foot and nail’d it to the plain.The laughing Trojan with a joyful spring.Leaps from his ambush and insults the king.,ilias
“He bleeds! (he cries) some god has sped my dart!Would the same god had fix’d it in his heart!So Troy relieved from that wide-wasting handShould breathe from slaughter and in combat stand:Whose sons now tremble at his darted spearAs scatter’d lambs the rushing lion fear.”,ilias
He dauntless thus: “Thou conqueror of the fairThou woman-warrior with the curling hair;Vain archer! trusting to the distant dartUnskill’d in arms to act a manly part!Thou hast but done what boys or women can;Such hands may wound but not incense a man.Nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gaveA coward’s weapon never hurts the brave.Not so this dart which thou may’st one day feel;Fate wings its flight and death is on the steel:Where this but lights some noble life expires;Its touch makes orphans bathes the cheeks of siresSteeps earth in purple gluts the birds of airAnd leaves such objects as distract the fair.”Ulysses hastens with a trembling heartBefore him steps and bending draws the dart:Forth flows the blood; an eager pang succeeds;Tydides mounts and to the navy speeds.,ilias
Now on the field Ulysses stands aloneThe Greeks all fled the Trojans pouring on;But stands collected in himself and wholeAnd questions thus his own unconquer’d soul:,ilias
“What further subterfuge what hopes remain?What shame inglorious if I quit the plain?What danger singly if I stand the groundMy friends all scatter’d all the foes around?Yet wherefore doubtful? let this truth sufficeThe brave meets danger and the coward flies.To die or conquer proves a hero’s heart;And knowing this I know a soldier’s part.”,ilias
Such thoughts revolving in his careful breastNear and more near the shady cohorts press’d;These in the warrior their own fate enclose;And round him deep the steely circle grows.So fares a boar whom all the troop surroundsOf shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds;He grinds his ivory tusks; he foams with ire;His sanguine eye-balls glare with living fire;By these by those on every part is plied;And the red slaughter spreads on every side.Pierced through the shoulder first Deiopis fell;Next Ennomus and Thoon sank to hell;Chersidamas beneath the navel thrustFalls prone to earth and grasps the bloody dust.Charops the son of Hippasus was near;Ulysses reach’d him with the fatal spear;But to his aid his brother Socus fliesSocus the brave the generous and the wise.Near as he drew the warrior thus began:,ilias
“O great Ulysses! much-enduring man!Not deeper skill’d in every martial sleightThan worn to toils and active in the fight!This day two brothers shall thy conquest graceAnd end at once the great Hippasian raceOr thou beneath this lance must press the field.”He said and forceful pierced his spacious shield:Through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrownPlough’d half his side and bared it to the bone.By Pallas’ care the spear though deep infix’dStopp’d short of life nor with his entrails mix’d.,ilias
The wound not mortal wise Ulysses knewThen furious thus (but first some steps withdrew):“Unhappy man! whose death our hands shall graceFate calls thee hence and finish’d is thy race.Nor longer check my conquests on the foe;But pierced by this to endless darkness goAnd add one spectre to the realms below!”,ilias
He spoke while Socus seized with sudden frightTrembling gave way and turn’d his back to flight;Between his shoulders pierced the following dartAnd held its passage through the panting heart:Wide in his breast appear’d the grisly wound;He falls; his armour rings against the ground.Then thus Ulysses gazing on the slain:“Famed son of Hippasus! there press the plain;There ends thy narrow span assign’d by fateHeaven owes Ulysses yet a longer date.Ah wretch! no father shall thy corpse compose;Thy dying eyes no tender mother close;But hungry birds shall tear those balls awayAnd hovering vultures scream around their prey.Me Greece shall honour when I meet my doomWith solemn funerals and a lasting tomb.”,ilias
Then raging with intolerable smartHe writhes his body and extracts the dart.The dart a tide of spouting gore pursuedAnd gladden’d Troy with sight of hostile blood.Now troops on troops the fainting chief invadeForced he recedes and loudly calls for aid.Thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears;The well-known voice thrice Menelaus hears:Alarm’d to Ajax Telamon he criedWho shares his labours and defends his side:“O friend! Ulysses’ shouts invade my ear;Distressed he seems and no assistance near;Strong as he is yet one opposed to allOppress’d by multitudes the best may fall.Greece robb’d of him must bid her host despairAnd feel a loss not ages can repair.”,ilias
Then where the cry directs his course he bends;Great Ajax like the god of war attendsThe prudent chief in sore distress they foundWith bands of furious Trojans compass’d round.223As when some huntsman with a flying spearFrom the blind thicket wounds a stately deer;Down his cleft side while fresh the blood distilsHe bounds aloft and scuds from hills to hillsTill life’s warm vapour issuing through the woundWild mountain-wolves the fainting beast surround:Just as their jaws his prostrate limbs invadeThe lion rushes through the woodland shadeThe wolves though hungry scour dispersed away;The lordly savage vindicates his prey.Ulysses thus unconquer’d by his painsA single warrior half a host sustains:But soon as Ajax leaves his tower-like shieldThe scattered crowds fly frighted o’er the field;Atrides’ arm the sinking hero staysAnd saved from numbers to his car conveys.,ilias
Victorious Ajax plies the routed crew;And first Doryclus Priam’s son he slewOn strong Pandocus next inflicts a woundAnd lays Lysander bleeding on the ground.As when a torrent swell’d with wintry rainsPours from the mountains o’er the deluged plainsAnd pines and oaks from their foundations tornA country’s ruins! to the seas are borne:Fierce Ajax thus o’erwhelms the yielding throng;Men steeds and chariots roll in heaps along.,ilias
But Hector from this scene of slaughter farRaged on the left and ruled the tide of war:Loud groans proclaim his progress through the plainAnd deep Scamander swells with heaps of slain.There Nestor and Idomeneus opposeThe warrior’s fury; there the battle glows;There fierce on foot or from the chariot’s heightHis sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight.The spouse of Helen dealing darts aroundHad pierced Machaon with a distant wound:In his right shoulder the broad shaft appear’dAnd trembling Greece for her physician fear’d.To Nestor then Idomeneus begun:“Glory of Greece old Neleus’ valiant son!Ascend thy chariot haste with speed awayAnd great Machaon to the ships convey;A wise physician skill’d our wounds to healIs more than armies to the public weal.”Old Nestor mounts the seat; beside him rodeThe wounded offspring of the healing god.He lends the lash; the steeds with sounding feetShake the dry field and thunder toward the fleet.,ilias
But now Cebriones from Hector’s carSurvey’d the various fortune of the war:“While here (he cried) the flying Greeks are slainTrojans on Trojans yonder load the plain.Before great Ajax see the mingled throngOf men and chariots driven in heaps along!I know him well distinguish’d o’er the fieldBy the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield.Thither O Hector thither urge thy steedsThere danger calls and there the combat bleeds;There horse and foot in mingled deaths uniteAnd groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight.”,ilias
“What god O Grecians! has your hearts dismay’d?Oh turn to arms; ’tis Ajax claims your aid.This hour he stands the mark of hostile rageAnd this the last brave battle he shall wage:Haste join your forces; from the gloomy graveThe warrior rescue and your country save.”Thus urged the chief: a generous troop appearsWho spread their bucklers and advance their spearsTo guard their wounded friend: while thus they standWith pious care great Ajax joins the band:Each takes new courage at the hero’s sight;The hero rallies and renews the fight.,ilias
Thus raged both armies like conflicting firesWhile Nestor’s chariot far from fight retires:His coursers steep’d in sweat and stain’d with goreThe Greeks’ preserver great Machaon bore.That hour Achilles from the topmost heightOf his proud fleet o’erlook’d the fields of fight;His feasted eyes beheld around the plainThe Grecian rout the slaying and the slain.His friend Machaon singled from the restA transient pity touch’d his vengeful breast.Straight to Menoetius’ much-loved son he sent:Graceful as Mars Patroclus quits his tent;In evil hour! Then fate decreed his doomAnd fix’d the date of all his woes to come.,ilias
“O first of friends! (Pelides thus replied)Still at my heart and ever at my side!The time is come when yon despairing hostShall learn the value of the man they lost:Now at my knees the Greeks shall pour their moanAnd proud Atrides tremble on his throne.Go now to Nestor and from him be taughtWhat wounded warrior late his chariot brought:For seen at distance and but seen behindHis form recall’d Machaon to my mind;Nor could I through yon cloud discern his faceThe coursers pass’d me with so swift a pace.”,ilias
Meantime Patroclus by Achilles sentUnheard approached and stood before the tent.Old Nestor rising then the hero ledTo his high seat: the chief refused and said:,ilias
This touch’d his generous heart and from the tentAlong the shore with hasty strides he went;Soon as he came where on the crowded strandThe public mart and courts of justice standWhere the tall fleet of great Ulysses liesAnd altars to the guardian gods arise;There sad he met the brave Euaemon’s sonLarge painful drops from all his members run;An arrow’s head yet rooted in his woundThe sable blood in circles mark’d the ground.As faintly reeling he confess’d the smartWeak was his pace but dauntless was his heart.Divine compassion touch’d Patroclus’ breastWho sighing thus his bleeding friend address’d:,ilias
“Ah hapless leaders of the Grecian host!Thus must ye perish on a barbarous coast?Is this your fate to glut the dogs with goreFar from your friends and from your native shore?Say great Eurypylus! shall Greece yet stand?Resists she yet the raging Hector’s hand?Or are her heroes doom’d to die with shameAnd this the period of our wars and fame?”,ilias
Eurypylus replies: “No more my friend;Greece is no more! this day her glories end;Even to the ships victorious Troy pursuesHer force increasing as her toil renews.Those chiefs that used her utmost rage to meetLie pierced with wounds and bleeding in the fleet.But thou Patroclus! act a friendly partLead to my ships and draw this deadly dart;With lukewarm water wash the gore away;With healing balms the raging smart allaySuch as sage Chiron sire of pharmacyOnce taught Achilles and Achilles thee.Of two famed surgeons Podalirius standsThis hour surrounded by the Trojan bands;And great Machaon wounded in his tentNow wants that succour which so oft he lent.”,ilias
To him the chief: “What then remains to do?The event of things the gods alone can view.Charged by Achilles’ great command I flyAnd bear with haste the Pylian king’s reply:But thy distress this instant claims relief.”He said and in his arms upheld the chief.The slaves their master’s slow approach survey’dAnd hides of oxen on the floor display’d:There stretch’d at length the wounded hero lay;Patroclus cut the forky steel away:Then in his hands a bitter root he bruised;The wound he wash’d the styptic juice infused.The closing flesh that instant ceased to glowThe wound to torture and the blood to flow.,ilias
The Greeks having retired into their intrenchments Hector attempts toforce them; but it proving impossible to pass the ditch Polydamasadvises to quit their chariots and manage the attack on foot. TheTrojans follow his counsel; and having divided their army into fivebodies of foot begin the assault. But upon the signal of an eagle witha serpent in his talons which appeared on the left hand of theTrojans Polydamas endeavours to withdraw them again. This Hectoropposes and continues the attack; in which after many actionsSarpedon makes the first breach in the wall. Hector also casting astone of vast size forces open one of the gates and enters at thehead of his troops who victoriously pursue the Grecians even to theirships.,ilias
While thus the hero’s pious cares attendThe cure and safety of his wounded friendTrojans and Greeks with clashing shields engageAnd mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage.Nor long the trench or lofty walls oppose;With gods averse the ill-fated works arose;Their powers neglected and no victim slainThe walls were raised the trenches sunk in vain.,ilias
Now with compacted shields in close arrayThe moving legions speed their headlong way:Already in their hopes they fire the fleetAnd see the Grecians gasping at their feet.,ilias
While every Trojan thus and every aidThe advice of wise Polydamas obey’dAsius alone confiding in his carHis vaunted coursers urged to meet the war.Unhappy hero! and advised in vain;Those wheels returning ne’er shall mark the plain;No more those coursers with triumphant joyRestore their master to the gates of Troy!Black death attends behind the Grecian wallAnd great Idomeneus shall boast thy fall!Fierce to the left he drives where from the plainThe flying Grecians strove their ships to gain;Swift through the wall their horse and chariots pass’dThe gates half-open’d to receive the last.Thither exulting in his force he flies:His following host with clamours rend the skies:To plunge the Grecians headlong in the mainSuch their proud hopes; but all their hopes were vain!,ilias
As when sharp Boreas blows abroad and bringsThe dreary winter on his frozen wings;Beneath the low-hung clouds the sheets of snowDescend and whiten all the fields below:So fast the darts on either army pourSo down the rampires rolls the rocky shower:Heavy and thick resound the batter’d shieldsAnd the deaf echo rattles round the fields.,ilias
With shame repulsed with grief and fury drivenThe frantic Asius thus accuses Heaven:“In powers immortal who shall now believe?Can those too flatter and can Jove deceive?What man could doubt but Troy’s victorious powerShould humble Greece and this her fatal hour?But like when wasps from hollow crannies driveTo guard the entrance of their common hiveDarkening the rock while with unwearied wingsThey strike the assailants and infix their stings;A race determined that to death contend:So fierce these Greeks their last retreats defend.Gods! shall two warriors only guard their gatesRepel an army and defraud the fates?”,ilias
These empty accents mingled with the windNor moved great Jove’s unalterable mind;To godlike Hector and his matchless mightWas owed the glory of the destined fight.Like deeds of arms through all the forts were triedAnd all the gates sustain’d an equal tide;Through the long walls the stony showers were heardThe blaze of flames the flash of arms appear’d.The spirit of a god my breast inspireTo raise each act to life and sing with fire!While Greece unconquer’d kept alive the warSecure of death confiding in despair;And all her guardian gods in deep dismayWith unassisting arms deplored the day.,ilias
“How oft my brother thy reproach I bearFor words well meant and sentiments sincere?True to those counsels which I judge the bestI tell the faithful dictates of my breast.To speak his thoughts is every freeman’s rightIn peace in war in council and in fight;And all I move deferring to thy swayBut tends to raise that power which I obey.Then hear my words nor may my words be vain!Seek not this day the Grecian ships to gain;For sure to warn us Jove his omen sentAnd thus my mind explains its clear event:The victor eagle whose sinister flightRetards our host and fills our hearts with frightDismiss’d his conquest in the middle skiesAllow’d to seize but not possess the prize;Thus though we gird with fires the Grecian fleetThough these proud bulwalks tumble at our feetToils unforeseen and fiercer are decreed;More woes shall follow and more heroes bleed.So bodes my soul and bids me thus advise;For thus a skilful seer would read the skies.”,ilias
Furious he spoke and rushing to the wallCalls on his host; his host obey the call;With ardour follow where their leader flies:Redoubling clamours thunder in the skies.Jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of IdeAnd drifts of dust the clouded navy hide;He fills the Greeks with terror and dismayAnd gives great Hector the predestined day.Strong in themselves but stronger in his aidClose to the works their rigid siege they laid.In vain the mounds and massy beams defendWhile these they undermine and those they rend;Upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall;And heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall.Greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms;The crowded bulwarks blaze with waving armsShield touching shield a long refulgent row;Whence hissing darts incessant rain below.The bold Ajaces fly from tower to towerAnd rouse with flame divine the Grecian power.The generous impulse every Greek obeys;Threats urge the fearful; and the valiant praise.,ilias
“Fellows in arms! whose deeds are known to fameAnd you whose ardour hopes an equal name!Since not alike endued with force or art;Behold a day when each may act his part!A day to fire the brave and warm the coldTo gain new glories or augment the old.Urge those who stand and those who faint excite;Drown Hector’s vaunts in loud exhorts of fight;Conquest not safety fill the thoughts of all;Seek not your fleet but sally from the wall;So Jove once more may drive their routed trainAnd Troy lie trembling in her walls again.”,ilias
Their ardour kindles all the Grecian powers;And now the stones descend in heavier showers.As when high Jove his sharp artillery formsAnd opes his cloudy magazine of storms;In winter’s bleak uncomfortable reignA snowy inundation hides the plain;He stills the winds and bids the skies to sleep;Then pours the silent tempest thick and deep;And first the mountain-tops are cover’d o’erThen the green fields and then the sandy shore;Bent with the weight the nodding woods are seenAnd one bright waste hides all the works of men:The circling seas alone absorbing allDrink the dissolving fleeces as they fall:So from each side increased the stony rainAnd the white ruin rises o’er the plain.,ilias
Thus godlike Hector and his troops contendTo force the ramparts and the gates to rend:Nor Troy could conquer nor the Greeks would yieldTill great Sarpedon tower’d amid the field;For mighty Jove inspired with martial flameHis matchless son and urged him on to fame.In arms he shines conspicuous from afarAnd bears aloft his ample shield in air;Within whose orb the thick bull-hides were roll’dPonderous with brass and bound with ductile gold:And while two pointed javelins arm his handsMajestic moves along and leads his Lycian bands.,ilias
So press’d with hunger from the mountain’s browDescends a lion on the flocks below;So stalks the lordly savage o’er the plainIn sullen majesty and stern disdain:In vain loud mastiffs bay him from afarAnd shepherds gall him with an iron war;Regardless furious he pursues his way;He foams he roars he rends the panting prey.,ilias
Resolved alike divine Sarpedon glowsWith generous rage that drives him on the foes.He views the towers and meditates their fallTo sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall;Then casting on his friend an ardent lookFired with the thirst of glory thus he spoke:,ilias
Swift at the word the herald speeds alongThe lofty ramparts through the martial throngAnd finds the heroes bathed in sweat and goreOpposed in combat on the dusty shore.“Ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands!Your aid (said Thoos) Peteus’ son demands;Your strength united best may help to bearThe bloody labours of the doubtful war:Thither the Lycian princes bend their courseThe best and bravest of the hostile force.But if too fiercely here the foes contendAt least let Telamon those towers defendAnd Teucer haste with his unerring bowTo share the danger and repel the foe.”,ilias
Straight to the fort great Ajax turn’d his careAnd thus bespoke his brothers of the war:“Now valiant Lycomede! exert your mightAnd brave Oileus prove your force in fight;To you I trust the fortune of the fieldTill by this arm the foe shall be repell’d:That done expect me to complete the day.Then with his sevenfold shield he strode away.”With equal steps bold Teucer press’d the shoreWhose fatal bow the strong Pandion bore.,ilias
High on the walls appear’d the Lycian powersLike some black tempest gathering round the towers:The Greeks oppress’d their utmost force unitePrepared to labour in the unequal fight:The war renews mix’d shouts and groans arise;Tumultuous clamour mounts and thickens in the skies.Fierce Ajax first the advancing host invadesAnd sends the brave Epicles to the shadesSarpedon’s friend. Across the warrior’s wayRent from the walls a rocky fragment lay;In modern ages not the strongest swainCould heave the unwieldy burden from the plain:He poised and swung it round; then toss’d on highIt flew with force and labour’d up the sky;Full on the Lycian’s helmet thundering downThe ponderous ruin crush’d his batter’d crown.As skilful divers from some airy steepHeadlong descend and shoot into the deepSo falls Epicles; then in groans expiresAnd murmuring to the shades the soul retires.,ilias
While to the ramparts daring Glaucus drewFrom Teucer’s hand a winged arrow flew;The bearded shaft the destined passage foundAnd on his naked arm inflicts a wound.The chief who fear’d some foe’s insulting boastMight stop the progress of his warlike hostConceal’d the wound and leaping from his heightRetired reluctant from the unfinish’d fight.Divine Sarpedon with regret beheldDisabled Glaucus slowly quit the field;His beating breast with generous ardour glowsHe springs to fight and flies upon the foes.Alcmaon first was doom’d his force to feel;Deep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel;Then from the yawning wound with fury toreThe spear pursued by gushing streams of gore:Down sinks the warrior with a thundering soundHis brazen armour rings against the ground.,ilias
Swift to the battlement the victor fliesTugs with full force and every nerve applies:It shakes; the ponderous stones disjointed yield;The rolling ruins smoke along the field.A mighty breach appears; the walls lie bare;And like a deluge rushes in the war.At once bold Teucer draws the twanging bowAnd Ajax sends his javelin at the foe;Fix’d in his belt the feather’d weapon stoodAnd through his buckler drove the trembling wood;But Jove was present in the dire debateTo shield his offspring and avert his fate.The prince gave back not meditating flightBut urging vengeance and severer fight;Then raised with hope and fired with glory’s charmsHis fainting squadrons to new fury warms.“O where ye Lycians is the strength you boast?Your former fame and ancient virtue lost!The breach lies open but your chief in vainAttempts alone the guarded pass to gain:Unite and soon that hostile fleet shall fall:The force of powerful union conquers all.”,ilias
This just rebuke inflamed the Lycian crew;They join they thicken and the assault renew:Unmoved the embodied Greeks their fury dareAnd fix’d support the weight of all the war;Nor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powersNor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers.As on the confines of adjoining groundsTwo stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds;They tug they sweat; but neither gain nor yieldOne foot one inch of the contended field;Thus obstinate to death they fight they fall;Nor these can keep nor those can win the wall.Their manly breasts are pierced with many a woundLoud strokes are heard and rattling arms resound;The copious slaughter covers all the shoreAnd the high ramparts drip with human gore.,ilias
The eight-and-twentieth day still continues. The scene is between theGrecian wall and the sea-shore.,ilias
When now the Thunderer on the sea-beat coastHad fix’d great Hector and his conquering hostHe left them to the fates in bloody frayTo toil and struggle through the well-fought day.Then turn’d to Thracia from the field of fightThose eyes that shed insufferable lightTo where the Mysians prove their martial forceAnd hardy Thracians tame the savage horse;And where the far-famed Hippomolgian straysRenown’d for justice and for length of days;229Thrice happy race! that innocent of bloodFrom milk innoxious seek their simple food:Jove sees delighted; and avoids the sceneOf guilty Troy of arms and dying men:No aid he deems to either host is givenWhile his high law suspends the powers of Heaven.,ilias
Meantime the monarch of the watery mainObserved the Thunderer nor observed in vain.In Samothracia on a mountain’s browWhose waving woods o’erhung the deeps belowHe sat; and round him cast his azure eyesWhere Ida’s misty tops confusedly rise;Below fair Ilion’s glittering spires were seen;The crowded ships and sable seas between.There from the crystal chambers of the mainEmerged he sat and mourn’d his Argives slain.At Jove incensed with grief and fury stungProne down the rocky steep he rush’d along;Fierce as he pass’d the lofty mountains nodThe forest shakes; earth trembled as he trodAnd felt the footsteps of the immortal god.From realm to realm three ample strides he tookAnd at the fourth the distant Ægae shook.,ilias
Far in the bay his shining palace standsEternal frame! not raised by mortal hands:This having reach’d his brass-hoof’d steeds he reinsFleet as the winds and deck’d with golden manes.Refulgent arms his mighty limbs infoldImmortal arms of adamant and gold.He mounts the car the golden scourge appliesHe sits superior and the chariot flies:His whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep;The enormous monsters rolling o’er the deepGambol around him on the watery wayAnd heavy whales in awkward measures play;The sea subsiding spreads a level plainExults and owns the monarch of the main;The parting waves before his coursers fly;The wondering waters leave his axle dry.,ilias
Deep in the liquid regions lies a caveBetween where Tenedos the surges laveAnd rocky Imbrus breaks the rolling wave:There the great ruler of the azure roundStopp’d his swift chariot and his steeds unboundFed with ambrosial herbage from his handAnd link’d their fetlocks with a golden bandInfrangible immortal: there they stay:The father of the floods pursues his way:Where like a tempest darkening heaven aroundOr fiery deluge that devours the groundThe impatient Trojans in a gloomy throngEmbattled roll’d as Hector rush’d along:To the loud tumult and the barbarous cryThe heavens re-echo and the shores reply:They vow destruction to the Grecian nameAnd in their hopes the fleets already flame.,ilias
But Neptune rising from the seas profoundThe god whose earthquakes rock the solid groundNow wears a mortal form; like Calchas seenSuch his loud voice and such his manly mien;His shouts incessant every Greek inspireBut most the Ajaces adding fire to fire.,ilias
“’Tis yours O warriors all our hopes to raise:Oh recollect your ancient worth and praise!’Tis yours to save us if you cease to fear;Flight more than shameful is destructive here.On other works though Troy with fury fallAnd pour her armies o’er our batter’d wall:There Greece has strength: but this this part o’erthrownHer strength were vain; I dread for you alone:Here Hector rages like the force of fireVaunts of his gods and calls high Jove his sire:If yet some heavenly power your breast exciteBreathe in your hearts and string your arms to fightGreece yet may live her threaten’d fleet maintain:And Hector’s force and Jove’s own aid be vain.”,ilias
Then with his sceptre that the deep controlsHe touch’d the chiefs and steel’d their manly souls:Strength not their own the touch divine impartsPrompts their light limbs and swells their daring hearts.Then as a falcon from the rocky heightHer quarry seen impetuous at the sightForth-springing instant darts herself from highShoots on the wing and skims along the sky:Such and so swift the power of ocean flew;The wide horizon shut him from their view.,ilias
“Some god my friend some god in human formFavouring descends and wills to stand the storm.Not Calchas this the venerable seer;Short as he turned I saw the power appear:I mark’d his parting and the steps he trod;His own bright evidence reveals a god.Even now some energy divine I shareAnd seem to walk on wings and tread in air!”,ilias
“With equal ardour (Telamon returns)My soul is kindled and my bosom burns;New rising spirits all my force alarmLift each impatient limb and brace my arm.This ready arm unthinking shakes the dart;The blood pours back and fortifies my heart:Singly methinks yon towering chief I meetAnd stretch the dreadful Hector at my feet.”,ilias
Full of the god that urged their burning breastThe heroes thus their mutual warmth express’d.Neptune meanwhile the routed Greeks inspired;Who breathless pale with length of labours tiredPant in the ships; while Troy to conquest callsAnd swarms victorious o’er their yielding walls:Trembling before the impending storm they lieWhile tears of rage stand burning in their eye.Greece sunk they thought and this their fatal hour;But breathe new courage as they feel the power.Teucer and Leitus first his words excite;Then stern Peneleus rises to the fight;Thoas Deipyrus in arms renown’dAnd Merion next the impulsive fury found;Last Nestor’s son the same bold ardour takesWhile thus the god the martial fire awakes:,ilias
These words the Grecians’ fainting hearts inspireAnd listening armies catch the godlike fire.Fix’d at his post was each bold Ajax foundWith well-ranged squadrons strongly circled round:So close their order so disposed their fightAs Pallas’ self might view with fix’d delight;Or had the god of war inclined his eyesThe god of war had own’d a just surprise.A chosen phalanx firm resolved as fateDescending Hector and his battle wait.An iron scene gleams dreadful o’er the fieldsArmour in armour lock’d and shields in shieldsSpears lean on spears on targets targets throngHelms stuck to helms and man drove man along.The floating plumes unnumber’d wave aboveAs when an earthquake stirs the nodding grove;And levell’d at the skies with pointing raysTheir brandish’d lances at each motion blaze.,ilias
Thus breathing death in terrible arrayThe close compacted legions urged their way:Fierce they drove on impatient to destroy;Troy charged the first and Hector first of Troy.As from some mountain’s craggy forehead tornA rock’s round fragment flies with fury borne(Which from the stubborn stone a torrent rends)Precipitate the ponderous mass descends:From steep to steep the rolling ruin bounds;At every shock the crackling wood resounds;Still gathering force it smokes; and urged amainWhirls leaps and thunders down impetuous to the plain:There stops—so Hector. Their whole force he proved230Resistless when he raged and when he stopp’d unmoved.,ilias
On him the war is bent the darts are shedAnd all their falchions wave around his head:Repulsed he stands nor from his stand retires;But with repeated shouts his army fires.“Trojans! be firm; this arm shall make your wayThrough yon square body and that black array:Stand and my spear shall rout their scattering powerStrong as they seem embattled like a tower;For he that Juno’s heavenly bosom warmsThe first of gods this day inspires our arms.”,ilias
He said; and roused the soul in every breast:Urged with desire of fame beyond the restForth march’d Deiphobus; but marching heldBefore his wary steps his ample shield.Bold Merion aim’d a stroke (nor aim’d it wide);The glittering javelin pierced the tough bull-hide;But pierced not through: unfaithful to his handThe point broke short and sparkled in the sand.The Trojan warrior touch’d with timely fearOn the raised orb to distance bore the spear.The Greek retreating mourn’d his frustrate blowAnd cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe;Then to the ships with surly speed he wentTo seek a surer javelin in his tent.,ilias
The god of ocean fired with stern disdainAnd pierced with sorrow for his grandson slainInspires the Grecian hearts confirms their handsAnd breathes destruction on the Trojan bands.Swift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleetHe finds the lance-famed Idomen of CreteHis pensive brow the generous care express’dWith which a wounded soldier touch’d his breastWhom in the chance of war a javelin toreAnd his sad comrades from the battle bore;Him to the surgeons of the camp he sent:That office paid he issued from his tentFierce for the fight: to whom the god begunIn Thoas’ voice Andraemon’s valiant sonWho ruled where Calydon’s white rocks ariseAnd Pleuron’s chalky cliffs emblaze the skies:,ilias
To whom the king: “On Greece no blame be thrown;Arms are her trade and war is all her own.Her hardy heroes from the well-fought plainsNor fear withholds nor shameful sloth detains:’Tis heaven alas! and Jove’s all-powerful doomThat far far distant from our native homeWills us to fall inglorious! Oh my friend!Once foremost in the fight still prone to lendOr arms or counsels now perform thy bestAnd what thou canst not singly urge the rest.”,ilias
Thus he: and thus the god whose force can makeThe solid globe’s eternal basis shake:“Ah! never may he see his native landBut feed the vultures on this hateful strandWho seeks ignobly in his ships to stayNor dares to combat on this signal day!For this behold! in horrid arms I shineAnd urge thy soul to rival acts with mine.Together let us battle on the plain;Two not the worst; nor even this succour vain:Not vain the weakest if their force unite;But ours the bravest have confess’d in fight.”,ilias
This said he rushes where the combat burns;Swift to his tent the Cretan king returns:From thence two javelins glittering in his handAnd clad in arms that lighten’d all the strandFierce on the foe the impetuous hero droveLike lightning bursting from the arm of JoveWhich to pale man the wrath of heaven declaresOr terrifies the offending world with wars;In streamy sparkles kindling all the skiesFrom pole to pole the trail of glory flies:Thus his bright armour o’er the dazzled throngGleam’d dreadful as the monarch flash’d along.,ilias
Him near his tent Meriones attends;Whom thus he questions: “Ever best of friends!O say in every art of battle skill’dWhat holds thy courage from so brave a field?On some important message art thou boundOr bleeds my friend by some unhappy wound?Inglorious here my soul abhors to stayAnd glows with prospects of th’ approaching day.”,ilias
“O prince! (Meriones replies) whose careLeads forth the embattled sons of Crete to war;This speaks my grief: this headless lance I wield;The rest lies rooted in a Trojan shield.”,ilias
To whom the Cretan: “Enter and receiveThe wonted weapons; those my tent can give;Spears I have store (and Trojan lances all)That shed a lustre round the illumined wallThough I disdainful of the distant warNor trust the dart nor aim the uncertain spearYet hand to hand I fight and spoil the slain;And thence these trophies and these arms I gain.Enter and see on heaps the helmets roll’dAnd high-hung spears and shields that flame with gold.”,ilias
“Nor vain (said Merion) are our martial toils;We too can boast of no ignoble spoils:But those my ship contains; whence distant farI fight conspicuous in the van of warWhat need I more? If any Greek there beWho knows not Merion I appeal to thee.”,ilias
To this Idomeneus: “The fields of fightHave proved thy valour and unconquer’d might:And were some ambush for the foes design’dEven there thy courage would not lag behind:In that sharp service singled from the restThe fear of each or valour stands confess’d.No force no firmness the pale coward shows;He shifts his place: his colour comes and goes:A dropping sweat creeps cold on every part;Against his bosom beats his quivering heart;Terror and death in his wild eye-balls stare;With chattering teeth he stands and stiffening hairAnd looks a bloodless image of despair!Not so the brave—still dauntless still the sameUnchanged his colour and unmoved his frame:Composed his thought determined is his eyeAnd fix’d his soul to conquer or to die:If aught disturb the tenour of his breast’Tis but the wish to strike before the rest.,ilias
“In such assays thy blameless worth is knownAnd every art of dangerous war thy own.By chance of fight whatever wounds you boreThose wounds were glorious all and all before;Such as may teach ’twas still thy brave delightT’oppose thy bosom where thy foremost fight.But why like infants cold to honour’s charmsStand we to talk when glory calls to arms?Go—from my conquer’d spears the choicest takeAnd to their owners send them nobly back.”,ilias
Swift at the word bold Merion snatch’d a spearAnd breathing slaughter follow’d to the war.So Mars armipotent invades the plain(The wide destroyer of the race of man)Terror his best-beloved son attends his courseArm’d with stern boldness and enormous force;The pride of haughty warriors to confoundAnd lay the strength of tyrants on the ground:From Thrace they fly call’d to the dire alarmsOf warring Phlegyans and Ephyrian arms;Invoked by both relentless they disposeTo these glad conquest murderous rout to those.So march’d the leaders of the Cretan trainAnd their bright arms shot horror o’er the plain.,ilias
Then first spake Merion: “Shall we join the rightOr combat in the centre of the fight?Or to the left our wonted succour lend?Hazard and fame all parts alike attend.”,ilias
“Not in the centre (Idomen replied:)Our ablest chieftains the main battle guide;Each godlike Ajax makes that post his careAnd gallant Teucer deals destruction thereSkill’d or with shafts to gall the distant fieldOr bear close battle on the sounding shield.These can the rage of haughty Hector tame:Safe in their arms the navy fears no flameTill Jove himself descends his bolts to shedAnd hurl the blazing ruin at our head.Great must he be of more than human birthNor feed like mortals on the fruits of earth.Him neither rocks can crush nor steel can woundWhom Ajax fells not on the ensanguined ground.In standing fight he mates Achilles’ forceExcell’d alone in swiftness in the course.Then to the left our ready arms applyAnd live with glory or with glory die.”,ilias
He said: and Merion to th’ appointed placeFierce as the god of battles urged his pace.Soon as the foe the shining chiefs beheldRush like a fiery torrent o’er the fieldTheir force embodied in a tide they pour;The rising combat sounds along the shore.As warring winds in Sirius’ sultry reignFrom different quarters sweep the sandy plain;On every side the dusty whirlwinds riseAnd the dry fields are lifted to the skies:Thus by despair hope rage together drivenMet the black hosts and meeting darken’d heaven.All dreadful glared the iron face of warBristled with upright spears that flash’d afar;Dire was the gleam of breastplates helms and shieldsAnd polish’d arms emblazed the flaming fields:Tremendous scene! that general horror gaveBut touch’d with joy the bosoms of the brave.,ilias
Saturn’s great sons in fierce contention viedAnd crowds of heroes in their anger died.The sire of earth and heaven by Thetis wonTo crown with glory Peleus’ godlike sonWill’d not destruction to the Grecian powersBut spared awhile the destined Trojan towers;While Neptune rising from his azure mainWarr’d on the king of heaven with stern disdainAnd breathed revenge and fired the Grecian train.Gods of one source of one ethereal raceAlike divine and heaven their native place;But Jove the greater; first-born of the skiesAnd more than men or gods supremely wise.For this of Jove’s superior might afraidNeptune in human form conceal’d his aid.These powers enfold the Greek and Trojan trainIn war and discord’s adamantine chainIndissolubly strong: the fatal tieIs stretch’d on both and close compell’d they die.,ilias
Stabb’d at the sight Deiphobus drew nighAnd made with force the vengeful weapon fly.The Cretan saw; and stooping caused to glanceFrom his slope shield the disappointed lance.Beneath the spacious targe (a blazing roundThick with bull-hides and brazen orbits boundOn his raised arm by two strong braces stay’d)He lay collected in defensive shade.O’er his safe head the javelin idly sungAnd on the tinkling verge more faintly rung.Even then the spear the vigorous arm confess’dAnd pierced obliquely king Hypsenor’s breast:Warm’d in his liver to the ground it boreThe chief his people’s guardian now no more!,ilias
“Not unattended (the proud Trojan cries)Nor unrevenged lamented Asius lies:For thee through hell’s black portals stand display’dThis mate shall joy thy melancholy shade.”,ilias
Heart-piercing anguish at the haughty boastTouch’d every Greek but Nestor’s son the most.Grieved as he was his pious arms attendAnd his broad buckler shields his slaughter’d friend:Till sad Mecistheus and Alastor boreHis honour’d body to the tented shore.,ilias
Then Idomen insulting o’er the slain:“Behold Deiphobus! nor vaunt in vain:See! on one Greek three Trojan ghosts attend;This my third victim to the shades I send.Approaching now thy boasted might approveAnd try the prowess of the seed of Jove.From Jove enamour’d of a mortal dameGreat Minos guardian of his country came:Deucalion blameless prince was Minos’ heir;His first-born I the third from Jupiter:O’er spacious Crete and her bold sons I reignAnd thence my ships transport me through the main:Lord of a host o’er all my host I shineA scourge to thee thy father and thy line.”,ilias
The Trojan heard; uncertain or to meetAlone with venturous arms the king of CreteOr seek auxiliar force; at length decreedTo call some hero to partake the deedForthwith Æneas rises to his thought:For him in Troy’s remotest lines he soughtWhere he incensed at partial Priam standsAnd sees superior posts in meaner hands.To him ambitious of so great an aidThe bold Deiphobus approach’d and said:,ilias
“Now Trojan prince employ thy pious armsIf e’er thy bosom felt fair honour’s charms.Alcathous dies thy brother and thy friend;Come and the warrior’s loved remains defend.Beneath his cares thy early youth was train’dOne table fed you and one roof contain’d.This deed to fierce Idomeneus we owe;Haste and revenge it on th’ insulting foe.”,ilias
He spoke and all as with one soul obey’d;Their lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shadeAround the chief. Æneas too demandsTh’ assisting forces of his native bands;Paris Deiphobus Agenor join;(Co-aids and captains of the Trojan line;)In order follow all th’ embodied trainLike Ida’s flocks proceeding o’er the plain;Before his fleecy care erect and boldStalks the proud ram the father of the bold.With joy the swain surveys them as he leadsTo the cool fountains through the well-known meads:So joys Æneas as his native bandMoves on in rank and stretches o’er the land.,ilias
Nor knew the furious father of his fall;High-throned amidst the great Olympian hallOn golden clouds th’ immortal synod sate;Detain’d from bloody war by Jove and Fate.,ilias
Now where in dust the breathless hero layFor slain Ascalaphus commenced the frayDeiphobus to seize his helmet fliesAnd from his temples rends the glittering prize;Valiant as Mars Meriones drew nearAnd on his loaded arm discharged his spear:He drops the weight disabled with the pain;The hollow helmet rings against the plain.Swift as a vulture leaping on his preyFrom his torn arm the Grecian rent awayThe reeking javelin and rejoin’d his friends.His wounded brother good Polites tends;Around his waist his pious arms he threwAnd from the rage of battle gently drew:Him his swift coursers on his splendid carRapt from the lessening thunder of the war;To Troy they drove him groaning from the shoreAnd sprinkling as he pass’d the sands with gore.,ilias
“Thus Trojans thus at length be taught to fear;O race perfidious who delight in war!Already noble deeds ye have perform’d;A princess raped transcends a navy storm’d:In such bold feats your impious might approveWithout th’ assistance or the fear of Jove.The violated rites the ravish’d dame;Our heroes slaughter’d and our ships on flameCrimes heap’d on crimes shall bend your glory downAnd whelm in ruins yon flagitious town.O thou great father! lord of earth and skiesAbove the thought of man supremely wise!If from thy hand the fates of mortals flowFrom whence this favour to an impious foe?A godless crew abandon’d and unjustStill breathing rapine violence and lust?The best of things beyond their measure cloy;Sleep’s balmy blessing love’s endearing joy;The feast the dance; whate’er mankind desireEven the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire.But Troy for ever reaps a dire delightIn thirst of slaughter and in lust of fight.”,ilias
This said he seized (while yet the carcase heaved)The bloody armour which his train received:Then sudden mix’d among the warring crewAnd the bold son of Pylaemenes slew.Harpalion had through Asia travell’d farFollowing his martial father to the war:Through filial love he left his native shoreNever ah never to behold it more!His unsuccessful spear he chanced to flingAgainst the target of the Spartan king;Thus of his lance disarm’d from death he fliesAnd turns around his apprehensive eyes.Him through the hip transpiercing as he fledThe shaft of Merion mingled with the dead.Beneath the bone the glancing point descendsAnd driving down the swelling bladder rends:Sunk in his sad companions’ arms he layAnd in short pantings sobb’d his soul away;(Like some vile worm extended on the ground;)While life’s red torrent gush’d from out the wound.,ilias
Him on his car the Paphlagonian trainIn slow procession bore from off the plain.The pensive father father now no more!Attends the mournful pomp along the shore;And unavailing tears profusely shed;And unrevenged deplored his offspring dead.,ilias
Paris from far the moving sight beheldWith pity soften’d and with fury swell’d:His honour’d host a youth of matchless graceAnd loved of all the Paphlagonian race!With his full strength he bent his angry bowAnd wing’d the feather’d vengeance at the foe.A chief there was the brave Euchenor namedFor riches much and more for virtue famed.Who held his seat in Corinth’s stately town;Polydus’ son a seer of old renown.Oft had the father told his early doomBy arms abroad or slow disease at home:He climb’d his vessel prodigal of breathAnd chose the certain glorious path to death.Beneath his ear the pointed arrow went;The soul came issuing at the narrow vent:His limbs unnerved drop useless on the groundAnd everlasting darkness shades him round.,ilias
Now had the Greeks eternal fame acquiredAnd the gall’d Ilians to their walls retired;But sage Polydamas discreetly braveAddress’d great Hector and this counsel gave:,ilias
The counsel pleased; and Hector with a boundLeap’d from his chariot on the trembling ground;Swift as he leap’d his clanging arms resound.“To guard this post (he cried) thy art employAnd here detain the scatter’d youth of Troy;Where yonder heroes faint I bend my wayAnd hasten back to end the doubtful day.”,ilias
This said the towering chief prepares to goShakes his white plumes that to the breezes flowAnd seems a moving mountain topp’d with snow.Through all his host inspiring force he fliesAnd bids anew the martial thunder rise.To Panthus’ son at Hector’s high commandHaste the bold leaders of the Trojan band:But round the battlements and round the plainFor many a chief he look’d but look’d in vain;Deiphobus nor Helenus the seerNor Asius’ son nor Asius’ self appear:For these were pierced with many a ghastly woundSome cold in death some groaning on the ground;Some low in dust (a mournful object) lay;High on the wall some breathed their souls away.,ilias
Far on the left amid the throng he found(Cheering the troops and dealing deaths around)The graceful Paris; whom with fury movedOpprobrious thus th’ impatient chief reproved:,ilias
“Ill-fated Paris! slave to womankindAs smooth of face as fraudulent of mind!Where is Deiphobus where Asius gone?The godlike father and th’ intrepid son?The force of Helenus dispensing fate;And great Othryoneus so fear’d of late?Black fate hang’s o’er thee from th’ avenging godsImperial Troy from her foundations nods;Whelm’d in thy country’s ruin shalt thou fallAnd one devouring vengeance swallow all.”,ilias
Thus stalk’d he dreadful; death was in his look:Whole nations fear’d; but not an Argive shook.The towering Ajax with an ample strideAdvanced the first and thus the chief defied:,ilias
“Hector! come on; thy empty threats forbear;’Tis not thy arm ’tis thundering Jove we fear:The skill of war to us not idly givenLo! Greece is humbled not by Troy but Heaven.Vain are the hopes that haughty mind impartsTo force our fleet: the Greeks have hands and hearts.Long ere in flames our lofty navy fallYour boasted city and your god-built wallShall sink beneath us smoking on the ground;And spread a long unmeasured ruin round.The time shall come when chased along the plainEven thou shalt call on Jove and call in vain;Even thou shalt wish to aid thy desperate courseThe wings of falcons for thy flying horse;Shalt run forgetful of a warrior’s fameWhile clouds of friendly dust conceal thy shame.”,ilias
As thus he spoke behold in open viewOn sounding wings a dexter eagle flew.To Jove’s glad omen all the Grecians riseAnd hail with shouts his progress through the skies:Far-echoing clamours bound from side to side;They ceased; and thus the chief of Troy replied:,ilias
“From whence this menace this insulting strain?Enormous boaster! doom’d to vaunt in vain.So may the gods on Hector life bestow(Not that short life which mortals lead belowBut such as those of Jove’s high lineage bornThe blue-eyed maid or he that gilds the morn)As this decisive day shall end the fameOf Greece and Argos be no more a name.And thou imperious! if thy madness waitThe lance of Hector thou shalt meet thy fate:That giant-corse extended on the shoreShall largely feast the fowls with fat and gore.”,ilias
He said; and like a lion stalk’d along:With shouts incessant earth and ocean rungSent from his following host: the Grecian trainWith answering thunders fill’d the echoing plain;A shout that tore heaven’s concave and aboveShook the fix’d splendours of the throne of Jove.,ilias
But not the genial feast nor flowing bowlCould charm the cares of Nestor’s watchful soul;His startled ears the increasing cries attend;Then thus impatient to his wounded friend:,ilias
“What new alarm divine Machaon sayWhat mix’d events attend this mighty day?Hark! how the shouts divide and how they meetAnd now come full and thicken to the fleet!Here with the cordial draught dispel thy careLet Hecamede the strengthening bath prepareRefresh thy wound and cleanse the clotted gore;While I the adventures of the day explore.”,ilias
He said: and seizing Thrasymedes’ shield(His valiant offspring) hasten’d to the field;(That day the son his father’s buckler bore;)Then snatch’d a lance and issued from the door.Soon as the prospect open’d to his viewHis wounded eyes the scene of sorrow knew;Dire disarray! the tumult of the fightThe wall in ruins and the Greeks in flight.As when old ocean’s silent surface sleepsThe waves just heaving on the purple deeps:While yet the expected tempest hangs on highWeighs down the cloud and blackens in the skyThe mass of waters will no wind obey;Jove sends one gust and bids them roll away.While wavering counsels thus his mind engageFluctuates in doubtful thought the Pylian sageTo join the host or to the general haste;Debating long he fixes on the last:Yet as he moves the sight his bosom warmsThe field rings dreadful with the clang of armsThe gleaming falchions flash the javelins fly;Blows echo blows and all or kill or die.,ilias
Him in his march the wounded princes meetBy tardy steps ascending from the fleet:The king of men Ulysses the divineAnd who to Tydeus owes his noble line.232(Their ships at distance from the battle standIn lines advanced along the shelving strand:Whose bay the fleet unable to containAt length; beside the margin of the mainRank above rank the crowded ships they moor:Who landed first lay highest on the shore.)Supported on the spears they took their wayUnfit to fight but anxious for the day.Nestor’s approach alarm’d each Grecian breastWhom thus the general of the host address’d:,ilias
“O grace and glory of the Achaian name;What drives thee Nestor from the field of fame?Shall then proud Hector see his boast fulfill’dOur fleets in ashes and our heroes kill’d?Such was his threat ah! now too soon made goodOn many a Grecian bosom writ in blood.Is every heart inflamed with equal rageAgainst your king nor will one chief engage?And have I lived to see with mournful eyesIn every Greek a new Achilles rise?”,ilias
Gerenian Nestor then: “So fate has will’d;And all-confirming time has fate fulfill’d.Not he that thunders from the aerial bowerNot Jove himself upon the past has power.The wall our late inviolable boundAnd best defence lies smoking on the ground:Even to the ships their conquering arms extendAnd groans of slaughter’d Greeks to heaven ascend.On speedy measures then employ your thoughtIn such distress! if counsel profit aught:Arms cannot much: though Mars our souls inciteThese gaping wounds withhold us from the fight.”,ilias
To him the monarch: “That our army bendsThat Troy triumphant our high fleet ascendsAnd that the rampart late our surest trustAnd best defence lies smoking in the dust;All this from Jove’s afflictive hand we bearWho far from Argos wills our ruin here.Past are the days when happier Greece was blestAnd all his favour all his aid confess’d;Now heaven averse our hands from battle tiesAnd lifts the Trojan glory to the skies.Cease we at length to waste our blood in vainAnd launch what ships lie nearest to the main;Leave these at anchor till the coming night:Then if impetuous Troy forbear the fightBring all to sea and hoist each sail for flight.Better from evils well foreseen to runThan perish in the danger we may shun.”,ilias
“Thy just reproofs (Atrides calm replies)Like arrows pierce me for thy words are wise.Unwilling as I am to lose the hostI force not Greece to quit this hateful coast;Glad I submit whoe’er or young or oldAught more conducive to our weal unfold.”,ilias
He added not: the listening kings obeySlow moving on; Atrides leads the way.The god of ocean (to inflame their rage)Appears a warrior furrowed o’er with age;Press’d in his own the general’s hand he tookAnd thus the venerable hero spoke:,ilias
“Atrides! lo! with what disdainful eyeAchilles sees his country’s forces fly;Blind impious man! whose anger is his guideWho glories in unutterable pride.So may he perish so may Jove disclaimThe wretch relentless and o’erwhelm with shame!But Heaven forsakes not thee: o’er yonder sandsSoon shall thou view the scattered Trojan bandsFly diverse; while proud kings and chiefs renown’dDriven heaps on heaps with clouds involved aroundOf rolling dust their winged wheels employTo hide their ignominious heads in Troy.”,ilias
He spoke then rush’d amid the warrior crewAnd sent his voice before him as he flewLoud as the shout encountering armies yieldWhen twice ten thousand shake the labouring field;Such was the voice and such the thundering soundOf him whose trident rends the solid ground.Each Argive bosom beats to meet the fightAnd grisly war appears a pleasing sight.,ilias
Meantime Saturnia from Olympus’ browHigh-throned in gold beheld the fields below;With joy the glorious conflict she survey’dWhere her great brother gave the Grecians aid.But placed aloft on Ida’s shady heightShe sees her Jove and trembles at the sight.Jove to deceive what methods shall she tryWhat arts to blind his all-beholding eye?At length she trusts her power; resolved to proveThe old yet still successful cheat of love;Against his wisdom to oppose her charmsAnd lull the lord of thunders in her arms.,ilias
“How long (to Venus thus apart she cried)Shall human strife celestial minds divide?Ah yet will Venus aid Saturnia’s joyAnd set aside the cause of Greece and Troy?”,ilias
“Then grant me (said the queen) those conquering charmsThat power which mortals and immortals warmsThat love which melts mankind in fierce desiresAnd burns the sons of heaven with sacred fires!,ilias
“For lo! I haste to those remote abodesWhere the great parents (sacred source of gods!)Ocean and Tethys their old empire keepOn the last limits of the land and deep.In their kind arms my tender years were past;What time old Saturn from Olympus castOf upper heaven to Jove resign’d the reignWhelm’d under the huge mass of earth and main.For strife I hear has made the union ceaseWhich held so long that ancient pair in peace.What honour and what love shall I obtainIf I compose those fatal feuds again;Once more their minds in mutual ties engageAnd what my youth has owed repay their age!”,ilias
She said. With awe divine the queen of loveObey’d the sister and the wife of Jove;And from her fragrant breast the zone embraced233With various skill and high embroidery graced.In this was every art and every charmTo win the wisest and the coldest warm:Fond love the gentle vow the gay desireThe kind deceit the still-reviving firePersuasive speech and the more persuasive sighsSilence that spoke and eloquence of eyes.This on her hand the Cyprian Goddess laid:“Take this and with it all thy wish;” she said.With smiles she took the charm; and smiling press’dThe powerful cestus to her snowy breast.,ilias
Then Venus to the courts of Jove withdrew;Whilst from Olympus pleased Saturnia flew.O’er high Pieria thence her course she boreO’er fair Emathia’s ever-pleasing shoreO’er Hemus’ hills with snows eternal crown’d;Nor once her flying foot approach’d the ground.Then taking wing from Athos’ lofty steepShe speeds to Lemnos o’er the rolling deepAnd seeks the cave of Death’s half-brother Sleep.234,ilias
“Sweet pleasing Sleep! (Saturnia thus began)Who spread’st thy empire o’er each god and man;If e’er obsequious to thy Juno’s willO power of slumbers! hear and favour still.Shed thy soft dews on Jove’s immortal eyesWhile sunk in love’s entrancing joys he lies.A splendid footstool and a throne that shineWith gold unfading Somnus shall be thine;The work of Vulcan; to indulge thy easeWhen wine and feasts thy golden humours please.”,ilias
“Imperial dame (the balmy power replies)Great Saturn’s heir and empress of the skies!O’er other gods I spread my easy chain;The sire of all old Ocean owns my reign.And his hush’d waves lie silent on the main.But how unbidden shall I dare to steepJove’s awful temples in the dew of sleep?Long since too venturous at thy bold commandOn those eternal lids I laid my hand;What time deserting Ilion’s wasted plainHis conquering son Alcides plough’d the main.When lo! the deeps arise the tempests roarAnd drive the hero to the Coan shore:Great Jove awaking shook the blest abodesWith rising wrath and tumbled gods on gods;Me chief he sought and from the realms on highHad hurl’d indignant to the nether skyBut gentle Night to whom I fled for aid(The friend of earth and heaven) her wings display’d;Impower’d the wrath of gods and men to tameEven Jove revered the venerable dame.”,ilias
“Vain are thy fears (the queen of heaven repliesAnd speaking rolls her large majestic eyes);Think’st thou that Troy has Jove’s high favour wonLike great Alcides his all-conquering son?Hear and obey the mistress of the skiesNor for the deed expect a vulgar prize;For know thy loved-one shall be ever thineThe youngest Grace Pasithae the divine.”235,ilias
“Swear then (he said) by those tremendous floodsThat roar through hell and bind the invoking gods:Let the great parent earth one hand sustainAnd stretch the other o’er the sacred main:Call the black Titans that with Chronos dwellTo hear and witness from the depths of hell;That she my loved-one shall be ever mineThe youngest Grace Pasithae the divine.”,ilias
The queen assents and from the infernal bowersInvokes the sable subtartarean powersAnd those who rule the inviolable floodsWhom mortals name the dread Titanian gods.,ilias
Then swift as wind o’er Lemnos’ smoky isleThey wing their way and Imbrus’ sea-beat soil;Through air unseen involved in darkness glideAnd light on Lectos on the point of Ide:(Mother of savages whose echoing hillsAre heard resounding with a hundred rills:)Fair Ida trembles underneath the god;Hush’d are her mountains and her forests nod.There on a fir whose spiry branches riseTo join its summit to the neighbouring skies;Dark in embowering shade conceal’d from sightSat Sleep in likeness of the bird of night.(Chalcis his name by those of heavenly birthBut call’d Cymindis by the race of earth.),ilias
To Ida’s top successful Juno flies;Great Jove surveys her with desiring eyes:The god whose lightning sets the heavens on fireThrough all his bosom feels the fierce desire;Fierce as when first by stealth he seized her charmsMix’d with her soul and melted in her arms:Fix’d on her eyes he fed his eager lookThen press’d her hand and thus with transport spoke:,ilias
Then she—“I haste to those remote abodesWhere the great parents of the deathless godsThe reverend Ocean and gray Tethys reignOn the last limits of the land and main.I visit these to whose indulgent caresI owe the nursing of my tender years:For strife I hear has made that union ceaseWhich held so long that ancient pair in peace.The steeds prepared my chariot to conveyO’er earth and seas and through the aerial wayWait under Ide: of thy superior powerTo ask consent I leave the Olympian bower;Nor seek unknown to thee the sacred cellsDeep under seas where hoary Ocean dwells.”,ilias
“For that (said Jove) suffice another day!But eager love denies the least delay.Let softer cares the present hour employAnd be these moments sacred all to joy.Ne’er did my soul so strong a passion proveOr for an earthly or a heavenly love:Not when I press’d Ixion’s matchless dameWhence rose Pirithous like the gods in fame:Not when fair Danae felt the shower of goldStream into life whence Perseus brave and bold.Not thus I burn’d for either Theban dame:(Bacchus from this from that Alcides came:)Nor Phoenix’ daughter beautiful and youngWhence godlike Rhadamanth and Minos sprung.236Not thus I burn’d for fair Latona’s faceNor comelier Ceres’ more majestic grace.Not thus even for thyself I felt desireAs now my veins receive the pleasing fire.”,ilias
He spoke; the goddess with the charming eyesGlows with celestial red and thus replies:“Is this a scene for love? On Ida’s heightExposed to mortal and immortal sight!Our joys profaned by each familiar eye;The sport of heaven and fable of the sky:How shall I e’er review the blest abodesOr mix among the senate of the gods?Shall I not think that with disorder’d charmsAll heaven beholds me recent from thy arms?With skill divine has Vulcan form’d thy bowerSacred to love and to the genial hour;If such thy will to that recess retireIn secret there indulge thy soft desire.”,ilias
She ceased; and smiling with superior loveThus answer’d mild the cloud-compelling Jove:“Nor god nor mortal shall our joys beholdShaded with clouds and circumfused in gold;Not even the sun who darts through heaven his raysAnd whose broad eye the extended earth surveys.”,ilias
Gazing he spoke and kindling at the viewHis eager arms around the goddess threw.Glad Earth perceives and from her bosom poursUnbidden herbs and voluntary flowers:Thick new-born violets a soft carpet spreadAnd clustering lotos swell’d the rising bedAnd sudden hyacinths the turf bestrow237And flamy crocus made the mountain glowThere golden clouds conceal the heavenly pairSteep’d in soft joys and circumfused with air;Celestial dews descending o’er the groundPerfume the mount and breathe ambrosia round:At length with love and sleep’s soft power oppress’dThe panting thunderer nods and sinks to rest.,ilias
Now to the navy borne on silent wingsTo Neptune’s ear soft Sleep his message brings;Beside him sudden unperceived he stoodAnd thus with gentle words address’d the god:,ilias
The troops assent; their martial arms they change:The busy chiefs their banded legions range.The kings though wounded and oppress’d with painWith helpful hands themselves assist the train.The strong and cumbrous arms the valiant wieldThe weaker warrior takes a lighter shield.Thus sheath’d in shining brass in bright arrayThe legions march and Neptune leads the way:His brandish’d falchion flames before their eyesLike lightning flashing through the frighted skies.Clad in his might the earth-shaking power appears;Pale mortals tremble and confess their fears.,ilias
When now they touch’d the mead’s enamell’d sideWhere gentle Xanthus rolls his easy tideWith watery drops the chief they sprinkle roundPlaced on the margin of the flowery ground.Raised on his knees he now ejects the gore;Now faints anew low-sinking on the shore;By fits he breathes half views the fleeting skiesAnd seals again by fits his swimming eyes.,ilias
Soon as the Greeks the chief’s retreat beheldWith double fury each invades the field.Oilean Ajax first his javelin spedPierced by whose point the son of Enops bled;(Satnius the brave whom beauteous Neis boreAmidst her flocks on Satnio’s silver shore;)Struck through the belly’s rim the warrior liesSupine and shades eternal veil his eyes.An arduous battle rose around the dead;By turns the Greeks by turns the Trojans bled.,ilias
Fired with revenge Polydamas drew nearAnd at Prothoenor shook the trembling spear;The driving javelin through his shoulder thrustHe sinks to earth and grasps the bloody dust.“Lo thus (the victor cries) we rule the fieldAnd thus their arms the race of Panthus wield:From this unerring hand there flies no dartBut bathes its point within a Grecian heart.Propp’d on that spear to which thou owest thy fallGo guide thy darksome steps to Pluto’s dreary hall.”,ilias
He said and sorrow touch’d each Argive breast:The soul of Ajax burn’d above the rest.As by his side the groaning warrior fellAt the fierce foe he launch’d his piercing steel;The foe reclining shunn’d the flying death;But fate Archilochus demands thy breath:Thy lofty birth no succour could impartThe wings of death o’ertook thee on the dart;Swift to perform heaven’s fatal will it fledFull on the juncture of the neck and headAnd took the joint and cut the nerves in twain:The dropping head first tumbled on the plain.So just the stroke that yet the body stoodErect then roll’d along the sands in blood.,ilias
“Here proud Polydamas here turn thy eyes!(The towering Ajax loud-insulting cries:)Say is this chief extended on the plainA worthy vengeance for Prothoenor slain?Mark well his port! his figure and his faceNor speak him vulgar nor of vulgar race;Some lines methinks may make his lineage knownAntenor’s brother or perhaps his son.”,ilias
He spake and smiled severe for well he knewThe bleeding youth: Troy sadden’d at the view.But furious Acamas avenged his cause;As Promachus his slaughtered brother drawsHe pierced his heart—“Such fate attends you allProud Argives! destined by our arms to fall.Not Troy alone but haughty Greece shall shareThe toils the sorrows and the wounds of war.Behold your Promachus deprived of breathA victim owed to my brave brother’s death.Not unappeased he enters Pluto’s gateWho leaves a brother to revenge his fate.”,ilias
Heart-piercing anguish struck the Grecian hostBut touch’d the breast of bold Peneleus most;At the proud boaster he directs his course;The boaster flies and shuns superior force.But young Ilioneus received the spear;Ilioneus his father’s only care:(Phorbas the rich of all the Trojan trainWhom Hermes loved and taught the arts of gain:)Full in his eye the weapon chanced to fallAnd from the fibres scoop’d the rooted ballDrove through the neck and hurl’d him to the plain;He lifts his miserable arms in vain!Swift his broad falchion fierce Peneleus spreadAnd from the spouting shoulders struck his head;To earth at once the head and helmet fly;The lance yet sticking through the bleeding eyeThe victor seized; and as aloft he shookThe gory visage thus insulting spoke:,ilias
“Trojans! your great Ilioneus behold!Haste to his father let the tale be told:Let his high roofs resound with frantic woeSuch as the house of Promachus must know;Let doleful tidings greet his mother’s earSuch as to Promachus’ sad spouse we bearWhen we victorious shall to Greece returnAnd the pale matron in our triumphs mourn.”,ilias
Dreadful he spoke then toss’d the head on high;The Trojans hear they tremble and they fly:Aghast they gaze around the fleet and wallAnd dread the ruin that impends on all.,ilias
Daughters of Jove! that on Olympus shineYe all-beholding all-recording nine!O say when Neptune made proud Ilion yieldWhat chief what hero first embrued the field?Of all the Grecians what immortal nameAnd whose bless’d trophies will ye raise to fame?,ilias
Thou first great Ajax! on the unsanguined plainLaid Hyrtius leader of the Mysian train.Phalces and Mermer Nestor’s son o’erthrewBold Merion Morys and Hippotion slew.Strong Periphaetes and Prothoon bledBy Teucer’s arrows mingled with the deadPierced in the flank by Menelaus’ steelHis people’s pastor Hyperenor fell;Eternal darkness wrapp’d the warrior roundAnd the fierce soul came rushing through the wound.But stretch’d in heaps before Oileus’ sonFall mighty numbers mighty numbers run;Ajax the less of all the Grecian raceSkill’d in pursuit and swiftest in the chase.,ilias
Jupiter awaking sees the Trojans repulsed from the trenches Hectorin a swoon and Neptune at the head of the Greeks: he is highlyincensed at the artifice of Juno who appeases him by her submissions;she is then sent to Iris and Apollo. Juno repairing to the assembly ofthe gods attempts with extraordinary address to incense them againstJupiter; in particular she touches Mars with a violent resentment; heis ready to take arms but is prevented by Minerva. Iris and Apolloobey the orders of Jupiter; Iris commands Neptune to leave the battleto which after much reluctance and passion he consents. Apolloreinspires Hector with vigour brings him back to the battle marchesbefore him with his aegis and turns the fortune of the fight. Hebreaks down great part of the Grecian wall: the Trojans rush in andattempt to fire the first line of the fleet but are as yet repelledby the greater Ajax with a prodigious slaughter.,ilias
Now in swift flight they pass the trench profoundAnd many a chief lay gasping on the ground:Then stopp’d and panted where the chariots lieFear on their cheek and horror in their eye.Meanwhile awaken’d from his dream of loveOn Ida’s summit sat imperial Jove:Round the wide fields he cast a careful viewThere saw the Trojans fly the Greeks pursue;These proud in arms those scatter’d o’er the plainAnd ’midst the war the monarch of the main.Not far great Hector on the dust he spies(His sad associates round with weeping eyes)Ejecting blood and panting yet for breathHis senses wandering to the verge of death.The god beheld him with a pitying lookAnd thus incensed to fraudful Juno spoke:,ilias
“O thou still adverse to the eternal willFor ever studious in promoting ill!Thy arts have made the godlike Hector yieldAnd driven his conquering squadrons from the field.Canst thou unhappy in thy wiles withstandOur power immense and brave the almighty hand?Hast thou forgot when bound and fix’d on highFrom the vast concave of the spangled skyI hung thee trembling in a golden chainAnd all the raging gods opposed in vain?Headlong I hurl’d them from the Olympian hallStunn’d in the whirl and breathless with the fall.For godlike Hercules these deeds were doneNor seem’d the vengeance worthy such a son:When by thy wiles induced fierce Boreas toss’dThe shipwreck’d hero on the Coan coastHim through a thousand forms of death I boreAnd sent to Argos and his native shore.Hear this remember and our fury dreadNor pull the unwilling vengeance on thy head;Lest arts and blandishments successless proveThy soft deceits and well-dissembled love.”,ilias
“By every oath that powers immortal tiesThe foodful earth and all-infolding skies;By thy black waves tremendous Styx! that flowThrough the drear realms of gliding ghosts below;By the dread honours of thy sacred headAnd that unbroken vow our virgin bed!Not by my arts the ruler of the mainSteeps Troy in blood and ranges round the plain:By his own ardour his own pity sway’dTo help his Greeks he fought and disobey’d:Else had thy Juno better counsels givenAnd taught submission to the sire of heaven.”,ilias
The trembling queen (the almighty order given)Swift from the Idaean summit shot to heaven.As some wayfaring man who wanders o’erIn thought a length of lands he trod beforeSends forth his active mind from place to placeJoins hill to dale and measures space with space:So swift flew Juno to the bless’d abodesIf thought of man can match the speed of gods.There sat the powers in awful synod placed;They bow’d and made obeisance as she pass’dThrough all the brazen dome: with goblets crown’d239They hail her queen; the nectar streams around.Fair Themis first presents the golden bowlAnd anxious asks what cares disturb her soul?,ilias
To whom the white-arm’d goddess thus replies:“Enough thou know’st the tyrant of the skiesSeverely bent his purpose to fulfilUnmoved his mind and unrestrain’d his will.Go thou the feasts of heaven attend thy call;Bid the crown’d nectar circle round the hall:But Jove shall thunder through the ethereal domeSuch stern decrees such threaten’d woes to comeAs soon shall freeze mankind with dire surpriseAnd damp the eternal banquets of the skies.”,ilias
The goddess said and sullen took her place;Black horror sadden’d each celestial face.To see the gathering grudge in every breastSmiles on her lips a spleenful joy express’d;While on her wrinkled front and eyebrow bentSat stedfast care and lowering discontent.Thus she proceeds—“Attend ye powers above!But know ’tis madness to contest with Jove:Supreme he sits; and sees in pride of sway.Your vassal godheads grudgingly obey:Fierce in the majesty of power controls;Shakes all the thrones of heaven and bends the poles.Submiss immortals! all he wills obey:And thou great Mars begin and show the way.Behold Ascalaphus! behold him dieBut dare not murmur dare not vent a sigh;Thy own loved boasted offspring lies o’erthrownIf that loved boasted offspring be thy own.”,ilias
Stern Mars with anguish for his slaughter’d sonSmote his rebelling breast and fierce begun:“Thus then immortals! thus shall Mars obey;Forgive me gods and yield my vengeance way:Descending first to yon forbidden plainThe god of battles dares avenge the slain;Dares though the thunder bursting o’er my headShould hurl me blazing on those heaps of dead.”,ilias
With that he gives command to Fear and FlightTo join his rapid coursers for the fight:Then grim in arms with hasty vengeance flies;Arms that reflect a radiance through the skies.And now had Jove by bold rebellion drivenDischarged his wrath on half the host of heaven;But Pallas springing through the bright abodeStarts from her azure throne to calm the god.Struck for the immortal race with timely fearFrom frantic Mars she snatch’d the shield and spear;Then the huge helmet lifting from his headThus to the impetuous homicide she said:,ilias
“By what wild passion furious! art thou toss’d?Striv’st thou with Jove? thou art already lost.Shall not the Thunderer’s dread command restrainAnd was imperial Juno heard in vain?Back to the skies wouldst thou with shame be drivenAnd in thy guilt involve the host of heaven?Ilion and Greece no more should Jove engageThe skies would yield an ampler scene of rage;Guilty and guiltless find an equal fateAnd one vast ruin whelm the Olympian state.Cease then thy offspring’s death unjust to call;Heroes as great have died and yet shall fall.Why should heaven’s law with foolish man complyExempted from the race ordain’d to die?”,ilias
This menace fix’d the warrior to his throne;Sullen he sat and curb’d the rising groan.Then Juno call’d (Jove’s orders to obey)The winged Iris and the god of day.“Go wait the Thunderer’s will (Saturnia cried)On yon tall summit of the fountful Ide:There in the father’s awful presence standReceive and execute his dread command.”,ilias
She said and sat; the god that gilds the dayAnd various Iris wing their airy way.Swift as the wind to Ida’s hills they came(Fair nurse of fountains and of savage game)There sat the eternal; he whose nod controlsThe trembling world and shakes the steady poles.Veil’d in a mist of fragrance him they foundWith clouds of gold and purple circled round.Well-pleased the Thunderer saw their earnest careAnd prompt obedience to the queen of air;Then (while a smile serenes his awful brow)Commands the goddess of the showery bow:,ilias
“Iris! descend and what we here ordainReport to yon mad tyrant of the main.Bid him from fight to his own deeps repairOr breathe from slaughter in the fields of air.If he refuse then let him timely weighOur elder birthright and superior sway.How shall his rashness stand the dire alarmsIf heaven’s omnipotence descend in arms?Strives he with me by whom his power was givenAnd is there equal to the lord of heaven?”,ilias
The all-mighty spoke; the goddess wing’d her flightTo sacred Ilion from the Idaean height.Swift as the rattling hail or fleecy snowsDrive through the skies when Boreas fiercely blows;So from the clouds descending Iris fallsAnd to blue Neptune thus the goddess calls:,ilias
“Attend the mandate of the sire above!In me behold the messenger of Jove:He bids thee from forbidden wars repairTo thine own deeps or to the fields of air.This if refused he bids thee timely weighHis elder birthright and superior sway.How shall thy rashness stand the dire alarmsIf heaven’s omnipotence descend in arms?Striv’st thou with him by whom all power is given?And art thou equal to the lord of heaven?”,ilias
“What means the haughty sovereign of the skies?(The king of ocean thus incensed replies;)Rule as he will his portion’d realms on high;No vassal god nor of his train am I.Three brother deities from Saturn cameAnd ancient Rhea earth’s immortal dame:Assign’d by lot our triple rule we know;Infernal Pluto sways the shades below;O’er the wide clouds and o’er the starry plainEthereal Jove extends his high domain;My court beneath the hoary waves I keepAnd hush the roarings of the sacred deep;Olympus and this earth in common lie:What claim has here the tyrant of the sky?Far in the distant clouds let him controlAnd awe the younger brothers of the pole;There to his children his commands be givenThe trembling servile second race of heaven.”,ilias
“And must I then (said she) O sire of floods!Bear this fierce answer to the king of gods?Correct it yet and change thy rash intent;A noble mind disdains not to repent.To elder brothers guardian fiends are givenTo scourge the wretch insulting them and heaven.”,ilias
“Great is the profit (thus the god rejoin’d)When ministers are blest with prudent mind:Warn’d by thy words to powerful Jove I yieldAnd quit though angry the contended field:Not but his threats with justice I disclaimThe same our honours and our birth the same.If yet forgetful of his promise givenTo Hermes Pallas and the queen of heavenTo favour Ilion that perfidious placeHe breaks his faith with half the ethereal race;Give him to know unless the Grecian trainLay yon proud structures level with the plainHowe’er the offence by other gods be pass’dThe wrath of Neptune shall for ever last.”,ilias
Thus speaking furious from the field he strodeAnd plunged into the bosom of the flood.The lord of thunders from his lofty heightBeheld and thus bespoke the source of light:,ilias
“What blest immortal with commanding breathThus wakens Hector from the sleep of death?Has fame not told how while my trusty swordBathed Greece in slaughter and her battle goredThe mighty Ajax with a deadly blowHad almost sunk me to the shades below?Even yet methinks the gliding ghosts I spyAnd hell’s black horrors swim before my eye.”,ilias
To him Apollo: “Be no more dismay’d;See and be strong! the Thunderer sends thee aid.Behold! thy Phoebus shall his arms employPhoebus propitious still to thee and Troy.Inspire thy warriors then with manly forceAnd to the ships impel thy rapid horse:Even I will make thy fiery coursers wayAnd drive the Grecians headlong to the sea.”,ilias
Thus to bold Hector spoke the son of JoveAnd breathed immortal ardour from above.As when the pamper’d steed with reins unboundBreaks from his stall and pours along the ground;With ample strokes he rushes to the floodTo bathe his sides and cool his fiery blood;His head now freed he tosses to the skies;His mane dishevell’d o’er his shoulders flies:He snuffs the females in the well-known plainAnd springs exulting to his fields again:Urged by the voice divine thus Hector flewFull of the god; and all his hosts pursue.As when the force of men and dogs combinedInvade the mountain goat or branching hind;Far from the hunter’s rage secure they lieClose in the rock (not fated yet to die)When lo! a lion shoots across the way!They fly: at once the chasers and the prey.So Greece that late in conquering troops pursuedAnd mark’d their progress through the ranks in bloodSoon as they see the furious chief appearForget to vanquish and consent to fear.,ilias
Thoas with grief observed his dreadful courseThoas the bravest of the Ætolian force;Skill’d to direct the javelin’s distant flightAnd bold to combat in the standing fightNot more in councils famed for solid senseThan winning words and heavenly eloquence.“Gods! what portent (he cried) these eyes invades?Lo! Hector rises from the Stygian shades!We saw him late by thundering Ajax kill’d:What god restores him to the frighted field;And not content that half of Greece lie slainPours new destruction on her sons again?He comes not Jove! without thy powerful will;Lo! still he lives pursues and conquers still!Yet hear my counsel and his worst withstand:The Greeks’ main body to the fleet command;But let the few whom brisker spirits warmStand the first onset and provoke the storm.Thus point your arms; and when such foes appearFierce as he is let Hector learn to fear.”,ilias
The Grecians gaze around with wild despairConfused and weary all the powers with prayer:Exhort their men with praises threats commands;And urge the gods with voices eyes and hands.Experienced Nestor chief obtests the skiesAnd weeps his country with a father’s eyes.,ilias
“O Jove! if ever on his native shoreOne Greek enrich’d thy shrine with offer’d gore;If e’er in hope our country to beholdWe paid the fattest firstlings of the fold;If e’er thou sign’st our wishes with thy nod:Perform the promise of a gracious god!This day preserve our navies from the flameAnd save the relics of the Grecian name.”,ilias
Thus prayed the sage: the eternal gave consentAnd peals of thunder shook the firmament.Presumptuous Troy mistook the accepting signAnd catch’d new fury at the voice divine.As when black tempests mix the seas and skiesThe roaring deeps in watery mountains riseAbove the sides of some tall ship ascendIts womb they deluge and its ribs they rend:Thus loudly roaring and o’erpowering allMount the thick Trojans up the Grecian wall;Legions on legions from each side arise:Thick sound the keels; the storm of arrows flies.Fierce on the ships above the cars belowThese wield the mace and those the javelin throw.,ilias
While thus the thunder of the battle ragedAnd labouring armies round the works engagedStill in the tent Patroclus sat to tendThe good Eurypylus his wounded friend.He sprinkles healing balms to anguish kindAnd adds discourse the medicine of the mind.But when he saw ascending up the fleetVictorious Troy; then starting from his seatWith bitter groans his sorrows he express’dHe wrings his hands he beats his manly breast.“Though yet thy state require redress (he cries)Depart I must: what horrors strike my eyes!Charged with Achilles’ high command I goA mournful witness of this scene of woe;I haste to urge him by his country’s careTo rise in arms and shine again in war.Perhaps some favouring god his soul may bend;The voice is powerful of a faithful friend.”,ilias
This said his eager javelin sought the foe:But Ajax shunn’d the meditated blow.Not vainly yet the forceful lance was thrown;It stretch’d in dust unhappy Lycophron:An exile long sustain’d at Ajax’ boardA faithful servant to a foreign lord;In peace and war for ever at his sideNear his loved master as he lived he died.From the high poop he tumbles on the sandAnd lies a lifeless load along the land.With anguish Ajax views the piercing sightAnd thus inflames his brother to the fight:,ilias
“Teucer behold! extended on the shoreOur friend our loved companion! now no more!Dear as a parent with a parent’s careTo fight our wars he left his native air.This death deplored to Hector’s rage we owe;Revenge revenge it on the cruel foe.Where are those darts on which the fates attend?And where the bow which Phoebus taught to bend?”,ilias
Impatient Teucer hastening to his aidBefore the chief his ample bow display’d;The well-stored quiver on his shoulders hung:Then hiss’d his arrow and the bowstring sung.Clytus Pisenor’s son renown’d in fame(To thee Polydamas! an honour’d name)Drove through the thickest of the embattled plainsThe startling steeds and shook his eager reins.As all on glory ran his ardent mindThe pointed death arrests him from behind:Through his fair neck the thrilling arrow flies;In youth’s first bloom reluctantly he dies.Hurl’d from the lofty seat at distance farThe headlong coursers spurn his empty car;Till sad Polydamas the steeds restrain’dAnd gave Astynous to thy careful hand;Then fired to vengeance rush’d amidst the foe:Rage edged his sword and strengthen’d every blow.,ilias
Once more bold Teucer in his country’s causeAt Hector’s breast a chosen arrow draws:And had the weapon found the destined wayThy fall great Trojan! had renown’d that day.But Hector was not doom’d to perish then:The all-wise disposer of the fates of men(Imperial Jove) his present death withstands;Nor was such glory due to Teucer’s hands.At its full stretch as the tough string he drewStruck by an arm unseen it burst in two;Down dropp’d the bow: the shaft with brazen headFell innocent and on the dust lay dead.The astonish’d archer to great Ajax cries;“Some god prevents our destined enterprise:Some god propitious to the Trojan foeHas from my arm unfailing struck the bowAnd broke the nerve my hands had twined with artStrong to impel the flight of many a dart.”,ilias
“Since heaven commands it (Ajax made reply)Dismiss the bow and lay thy arrows by:Thy arms no less suffice the lance to wieldAnd quit the quiver for the ponderous shield.In the first ranks indulge thy thirst of fameThy brave example shall the rest inflame.Fierce as they are by long successes vain;To force our fleet or even a ship to gainAsks toil and sweat and blood: their utmost mightShall find its match—No more: ’tis ours to fight.”,ilias
Then Teucer laid his faithless bow aside;The fourfold buckler o’er his shoulder tied;On his brave head a crested helm he placedWith nodding horse-hair formidably graced;A dart whose point with brass refulgent shinesThe warrior wields; and his great brother joins.,ilias
This Hector saw and thus express’d his joy:“Ye troops of Lycia Dardanus and Troy!Be mindful of yourselves your ancient fameAnd spread your glory with the navy’s flame.Jove is with us; I saw his hand but nowFrom the proud archer strike his vaunted bow:Indulgent Jove! how plain thy favours shineWhen happy nations bear the marks divine!How easy then to see the sinking stateOf realms accursed deserted reprobate!Such is the fate of Greece and such is ours:Behold ye warriors and exert your powers.Death is the worst; a fate which all must try;And for our country ’tis a bliss to die.The gallant man though slain in fight he beYet leaves his nation safe his children free;Entails a debt on all the grateful state;His own brave friends shall glory in his fate;His wife live honour’d all his race succeedAnd late posterity enjoy the deed!”,ilias
“How long ye warriors of the Argive race(To generous Argos what a dire disgrace!)How long on these cursed confines will ye lieYet undetermined or to live or die?What hopes remain what methods to retireIf once your vessels catch the Trojan fire?Mark how the flames approach how near they fallHow Hector calls and Troy obeys his call!Not to the dance that dreadful voice invitesIt calls to death and all the rage of fights.’Tis now no time for wisdom or debates;To your own hands are trusted all your fates;And better far in one decisive strifeOne day should end our labour or our lifeThan keep this hard-got inch of barren sandsStill press’d and press’d by such inglorious hands.”,ilias
“Lo Melanippus! lo where Dolops lies;And is it thus our royal kinsman dies?O’ermatch’d he falls; to two at once a preyAnd lo! they bear the bloody arms away!Come on—a distant war no longer wageBut hand to hand thy country’s foes engage:Till Greece at once and all her glory end;Or Ilion from her towery height descendHeaved from the lowest stone; and bury allIn one sad sepulchre one common fall.”,ilias
Hector (this said) rush’d forward on the foes:With equal ardour Melanippus glows:Then Ajax thus—“O Greeks! respect your fameRespect yourselves and learn an honest shame:Let mutual reverence mutual warmth inspireAnd catch from breast to breast the noble fireOn valour’s side the odds of combat lie;The brave live glorious or lamented die;The wretch that trembles in the field of fameMeets death and worse than death eternal shame.”,ilias
His generous sense he not in vain imparts;It sunk and rooted in the Grecian hearts:They join they throng they thicken at his callAnd flank the navy with a brazen wall;Shields touching shields in order blaze aboveAnd stop the Trojans though impell’d by Jove.The fiery Spartan first with loud applause.Warms the bold son of Nestor in his cause.“Is there (he said) in arms a youth like youSo strong to fight so active to pursue?Why stand you distant nor attempt a deed?Lift the bold lance and make some Trojan bleed.”,ilias
Now all on fire for fame his breast his eyesBurn at each foe and single every prize;Still at the closest ranks the thickest fightHe points his ardour and exerts his might.The Grecian phalanx moveless as a towerOn all sides batter’d yet resists his power:So some tall rock o’erhangs the hoary main241By winds assail’d by billows beat in vainUnmoved it hears above the tempest blowAnd sees the watery mountains break below.Girt in surrounding flames he seems to fallLike fire from Jove and bursts upon them all:Bursts as a wave that from the cloud impendsAnd swell’d with tempests on the ship descends;White are the decks with foam; the winds aloudHowl o’er the masts and sing through every shroud:Pale trembling tired the sailors freeze with fears;And instant death on every wave appears.So pale the Greeks the eyes of Hector meetThe chief so thunders and so shakes the fleet.,ilias
Chased from the foremost line the Grecian trainNow man the next receding toward the main:Wedged in one body at the tents they standWall’d round with sterns a gloomy desperate band.Now manly shame forbids the inglorious flight;Now fear itself confines them to the fight:Man courage breathes in man; but Nestor most(The sage preserver of the Grecian host)Exhorts adjures to guard these utmost shores;And by their parents by themselves implores.,ilias
“Oh friends! be men: your generous breasts inflameWith mutual honour and with mutual shame!Think of your hopes your fortunes; all the careYour wives your infants and your parents share:Think of each living father’s reverend head;Think of each ancestor with glory dead;Absent by me they speak by me they sueThey ask their safety and their fame from you:The gods their fates on this one action layAnd all are lost if you desert the day.”,ilias
’Twas thou bold Hector! whose resistless handFirst seized a ship on that contested strand;The same which dead Protesilaus bore242The first that touch’d the unhappy Trojan shore:For this in arms the warring nations stoodAnd bathed their generous breasts with mutual blood.No room to poise the lance or bend the bow;But hand to hand and man to man they grow:Wounded they wound; and seek each other’s heartsWith falchions axes swords and shorten’d darts.The falchions ring shields rattle axes soundSwords flash in air or glitter on the ground;With streaming blood the slippery shores are dyedAnd slaughter’d heroes swell the dreadful tide.,ilias
“Haste bring the flames! that toil of ten long yearsIs finished; and the day desired appears!This happy day with acclamations greetBright with destruction of yon hostile fleet.The coward-counsels of a timorous throngOf reverend dotards check’d our glory long:Too long Jove lull’d us with lethargic charmsBut now in peals of thunder calls to arms:In this great day he crowns our full desiresWakes all our force and seconds all our fires.”,ilias
He spoke—the warriors at his fierce commandPour a new deluge on the Grecian band.Even Ajax paused (so thick the javelins fly)Stepp’d back and doubted or to live or die.Yet where the oars are placed he stands to waitWhat chief approaching dares attempt his fate:Even to the last his naval charge defendsNow shakes his spear now lifts and now protends;Even yet the Greeks with piercing shouts inspiresAmidst attacks and deaths and darts and fires.,ilias
“O friends! O heroes! names for ever dearOnce sons of Mars and thunderbolts of war!Ah! yet be mindful of your old renownYour great forefathers’ virtues and your own.What aids expect you in this utmost strait?What bulwarks rising between you and fate?No aids no bulwarks your retreat attendNo friends to help no city to defend.This spot is all you have to lose or keep;There stand the Trojans and here rolls the deep.’Tis hostile ground you tread; your native landsFar far from hence: your fates are in your hands.”,ilias
Raging he spoke; nor further wastes his breathBut turns his javelin to the work of death.Whate’er bold Trojan arm’d his daring handsAgainst the sable ships with flaming brandsSo well the chief his naval weapon spedThe luckless warrior at his stern lay dead:Full twelve the boldest in a moment fellSent by great Ajax to the shades of hell.,ilias
Patroclus (in pursuance of the request of Nestor in the eleventh book)entreats Achilles to suffer him to go to the assistance of the Greekswith Achilles’ troops and armour. He agrees to it but at the same timecharges him to content himself with rescuing the fleet without furtherpursuit of the enemy. The armour horses soldiers and officers aredescribed. Achilles offers a libation for the success of his friendafter which Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle. The Trojans atthe sight of Patroclus in Achilles’ armour taking him for that heroare cast into the uttermost consternation; he beats them off from thevessels Hector himself flies Sarpedon is killed though Jupiter wasaverse to his fate. Several other particulars of the battle aredescribed; in the heat of which Patroclus neglecting the orders ofAchilles pursues the foe to the walls of Troy where Apollo repulsesand disarms him Euphorbus wounds him and Hector kills him whichconcludes the book.,ilias
So warr’d both armies on the ensanguined shoreWhile the black vessels smoked with human gore.Meantime Patroclus to Achilles flies;The streaming tears fall copious from his eyes.Not faster trickling to the plains belowFrom the tall rock the sable waters flow.Divine Pelides with compassion moved.Thus spoke indulgent to his best beloved:243,ilias
“Patroclus say what grief thy bosom bearsThat flows so fast in these unmanly tears?No girl no infant whom the mother keepsFrom her loved breast with fonder passion weeps;Not more the mother’s soul that infant warmsClung to her knees and reaching at her armsThan thou hast mine! Oh tell me to what endThy melting sorrows thus pursue thy friend?,ilias
“Griev’st thou for me or for my martial band?Or come sad tidings from our native land?Our fathers live (our first most tender care)Thy good Menoetius breathes the vital airAnd hoary Peleus yet extends his days;Pleased in their age to hear their children’s praise.Or may some meaner cause thy pity claim?Perhaps yon relics of the Grecian nameDoom’d in their ships to sink by fire and swordAnd pay the forfeit of their haughty lord?Whate’er the cause reveal thy secret careAnd speak those sorrows which a friend would share.”A sigh that instant from his bosom brokeAnother follow’d and Patroclus spoke:,ilias
“Let Greece at length with pity touch thy breastThyself a Greek; and once of Greeks the best!Lo! every chief that might her fate preventLies pierced with wounds and bleeding in his tent:Eurypylus Tydides Atreus’ sonAnd wise Ulysses at the navy groanMore for their country’s wounds than for their own.Their pain soft arts of pharmacy can easeThy breast alone no lenitives appease.May never rage like thine my soul enslaveO great in vain! unprofitably brave!Thy country slighted in her last distressWhat friend what man from thee shall hope redress?No—men unborn and ages yet behindShall curse that fierce that unforgiving mind.,ilias
“O man unpitying! if of man thy race;But sure thou spring’st not from a soft embraceNor ever amorous hero caused thy birthNor ever tender goddess brought thee forth:Some rugged rock’s hard entrails gave thee formAnd raging seas produced thee in a stormA soul well suiting that tempestuous kindSo rough thy manners so untamed thy mind.,ilias
Stern Hector waved his sword and standing nearWhere furious Ajax plied his ashen spearFull on the lance a stroke so justly spedThat the broad falchion lopp’d its brazen head;His pointless spear the warrior shakes in vain;The brazen head falls sounding on the plain.Great Ajax saw and own’d the hand divine;Confessing Jove and trembling at the signWarn’d he retreats. Then swift from all sides pourThe hissing brands; thick streams the fiery shower;O’er the high stern the curling volumes riseAnd sheets of rolling smoke involve the skies.,ilias
Divine Achilles view’d the rising flamesAnd smote his thigh and thus aloud exclaims:“Arm arm Patroclus! Lo the blaze aspires!The glowing ocean reddens with the fires.Arm ere our vessels catch the spreading flame;Arm ere the Grecians be no more a name;I haste to bring the troops.”—The hero said;The friend with ardour and with joy obey’d.,ilias
He cased his limbs in brass; and first aroundHis manly legs with silver buckles boundThe clasping greaves; then to his breast appliesThe flaming cuirass of a thousand dyes;Emblazed with studs of gold his falchion shoneIn the rich belt as in a starry zone:Achilles’ shield his ample shoulders spreadAchilles’ helmet nodded o’er his head:Adorn’d in all his terrible arrayHe flash’d around intolerable day.Alone untouch’d Pelides’ javelin standsNot to be poised but by Pelides’ hands:From Pelion’s shady brow the plant entireOld Chiron rent and shaped it for his sire;Whose son’s great arm alone the weapon wieldsThe death of heroes and the dread of fields.,ilias
The brave Automedon (an honour’d nameThe second to his lord in love and fameIn peace his friend and partner of the war)The winged coursers harness’d to the car;Xanthus and Balius of immortal breedSprung from the wind and like the wind in speed.Whom the wing’d harpy swift Podarge boreBy Zephyr pregnant on the breezy shore:Swift Pedasus was added to their side(Once great Aetion’s now Achilles’ pride)Who like in strength in swiftness and in graceA mortal courser match’d the immortal race.,ilias
Achilles speeds from tent to tent and warmsHis hardy Myrmidons to blood and arms.All breathing death around the chief they standA grim terrific formidable band:Grim as voracious wolves that seek the springs244When scalding thirst their burning bowels wrings;When some tall stag fresh-slaughtered in the woodHas drench’d their wide insatiate throats with bloodTo the black fount they rush a hideous throngWith paunch distended and with lolling tongueFire fills their eye their black jaws belch the goreAnd gorged with slaughter still they thirst for more.Like furious rush’d the Myrmidonian crewSuch their dread strength and such their deathful view.,ilias
High in the midst the great Achilles standsDirects their order and the war commands.He loved of Jove had launch’d for Ilion’s shoresFull fifty vessels mann’d with fifty oars:Five chosen leaders the fierce bands obeyHimself supreme in valour as in sway.,ilias
First march’d Menestheus of celestial birthDerived from thee whose waters wash the earthDivine Sperchius! Jove-descended flood!A mortal mother mixing with a god.Such was Menestheus but miscall’d by fameThe son of Borus that espoused the dame.,ilias
Eudorus next; whom Polymele the gayFamed in the graceful dance produced to-day.Her sly Cellenius loved: on her would gazeAs with swift step she form’d the running maze:To her high chamber from Diana’s quireThe god pursued her urged and crown’d his fire.The son confess’d his father’s heavenly raceAnd heir’d his mother’s swiftness in the chase.Strong Echecleus bless’d in all those charmsThat pleased a god succeeded to her arms;Not conscious of those loves long hid from fameWith gifts of price he sought and won the dame;Her secret offspring to her sire she bare;Her sire caress’d him with a parent’s care.,ilias
Pisander follow’d; matchless in his artTo wing the spear or aim the distant dart;No hand so sure of all the Emathian lineOr if a surer great Patroclus! thine.,ilias
Soon as Achilles with superior careHad call’d the chiefs and order’d all the warThis stern remembrance to his troops he gave:“Ye far-famed Myrmidons ye fierce and brave!Think with what threats you dared the Trojan throngThink what reproach these ears endured so long;‘Stern son of Peleus (thus ye used to sayWhile restless raging in your ships you lay)Oh nursed with gall unknowing how to yield;Whose rage defrauds us of so famed a field:If that dire fury must for ever burnWhat make we here? Return ye chiefs return!’Such were your words—Now warriors! grieve no moreLo there the Trojans; bathe your swords in gore!This day shall give you all your soul demandsGlut all your hearts and weary all your hands!”,ilias
Thus while he roused the fire in every breastClose and more close the listening cohorts press’d;Ranks wedged in ranks; of arms a steely ringStill grows and spreads and thickens round the king.As when a circling wall the builder formsOf strength defensive against wind and stormsCompacted stones the thickening work composeAnd round him wide the rising structure grows:So helm to helm and crest to crest they throngShield urged on shield and man drove man along;Thick undistinguish’d plumes together join’dFloat in one sea and wave before the wind.,ilias
Far o’er the rest in glittering pomp appearThere bold Automedon Patroclus here;Brothers in arms with equal fury fired;Two friends two bodies with one soul inspired.,ilias
But mindful of the gods Achilles wentTo the rich coffer in his shady tent;There lay on heaps his various garments roll’dAnd costly furs and carpets stiff with gold(The presents of the silver-footed dame)From thence he took a bowl of antique frameWhich never man had stained with ruddy wineNor raised in offerings to the power divineBut Peleus’ son; and Peleus’ son to noneHad raised in offerings but to Jove alone.This tinged with sulphur sacred first to flameHe purged; and wash’d it in the running stream.Then cleansed his hands; and fixing for a spaceHis eyes on heaven his feet upon the placeOf sacrifice the purple draught he pour’dForth in the midst; and thus the god implored:,ilias
“O thou supreme! high-throned all height above!O great Pelasgic Dodonaean Jove!Who ’midst surrounding frosts and vapours chillPresid’st on bleak Dodona’s vocal hill:(Whose groves the Selli race austere! surroundTheir feet unwash’d their slumbers on the ground;Who hear from rustling oaks thy dark decrees;And catch the fates low-whispered in the breeze;)Hear as of old! Thou gav’st at Thetis’ prayerGlory to me and to the Greeks despair.Lo to the dangers of the fighting fieldThe best the dearest of my friends I yieldThough still determined to my ships confined;Patroclus gone I stay but half behind.Oh! be his guard thy providential careConfirm his heart and string his arm to war:Press’d by his single force let Hector seeHis fame in arms not owing all to me.But when the fleets are saved from foes and fireLet him with conquest and renown retire;Preserve his arms preserve his social trainAnd safe return him to these eyes again!”,ilias
Great Jove consents to half the chief’s requestBut heaven’s eternal doom denies the rest;To free the fleet was granted to his prayer;His safe return the winds dispersed in air.Back to his tent the stern Achilles fliesAnd waits the combat with impatient eyes.,ilias
Meanwhile the troops beneath Patroclus’ careInvade the Trojans and commence the war.As wasps provoked by children in their playPour from their mansions by the broad highwayIn swarms the guiltless traveller engageWhet all their stings and call forth all their rage:All rise in arms and with a general cryAssert their waxen domes and buzzing progeny.Thus from the tents the fervent legion swarmsSo loud their clamours and so keen their arms:Their rising rage Patroclus’ breath inspiresWho thus inflames them with heroic fires:,ilias
“O warriors partners of Achilles’ praise!Be mindful of your deeds in ancient days;Your godlike master let your acts proclaimAnd add new glories to his mighty name.Think your Achilles sees you fight: be braveAnd humble the proud monarch whom you save.”,ilias
Joyful they heard and kindling as he spokeFlew to the fleet involved in fire and smoke.From shore to shore the doubling shouts resoundThe hollow ships return a deeper sound.The war stood still and all around them gazedWhen great Achilles’ shining armour blazed:Troy saw and thought the dread Achilles nighAt once they see they tremble and they fly.,ilias
But Troy repulsed and scatter’d o’er the plainsForced from the navy yet the fight maintains.Now every Greek some hostile hero slewBut still the foremost bold Patroclus flew:As Areilycus had turn’d him roundSharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound;The brazen-pointed spear with vigour thrownThe thigh transfix’d and broke the brittle bone:Headlong he fell. Next Thoas was thy chance;Thy breast unarm’d received the Spartan lance.Phylides’ dart (as Amphidus drew nigh)His blow prevented and transpierced his thighTore all the brawn and rent the nerves away;In darkness and in death the warrior lay.,ilias
In equal arms two sons of Nestor standAnd two bold brothers of the Lycian band:By great Antilochus Atymnius diesPierced in the flank lamented youth! he liesKind Maris bleeding in his brother’s woundDefends the breathless carcase on the ground;Furious he flies his murderer to engage:But godlike Thrasimed prevents his rageBetween his arm and shoulder aims a blow;His arm falls spouting on the dust below:He sinks with endless darkness cover’d o’er:And vents his soul effused with gushing gore.,ilias
Slain by two brothers thus two brothers bleedSarpedon’s friends Amisodarus’ seed;Amisodarus who by Furies ledThe bane of men abhorr’d Chimaera bred;Skill’d in the dart in vain his sons expireAnd pay the forfeit of their guilty sire.,ilias
Stopp’d in the tumult Cleobulus liesBeneath Oileus’ arm a living prize;A living prize not long the Trojan stood;The thirsty falchion drank his reeking blood:Plunged in his throat the smoking weapon lies;Black death and fate unpitying seal his eyes.,ilias
Amid the ranks with mutual thirst of fameLycon the brave and fierce Peneleus came;In vain their javelins at each other flewNow met in arms their eager swords they drew.On the plumed crest of his Boeotian foeThe daring Lycon aim’d a noble blow;The sword broke short; but his Peneleus spedFull on the juncture of the neck and head:The head divided by a stroke so justHung by the skin; the body sunk to dust.,ilias
O’ertaken Neamas by Merion bleedsPierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;Back from the car he tumbles to the ground:His swimming eyes eternal shades surround.,ilias
Next Erymas was doom’d his fate to feelHis open’d mouth received the Cretan steel:Beneath the brain the point a passage toreCrash’d the thin bones and drown’d the teeth in gore:His mouth his eyes his nostrils pour a flood;He sobs his soul out in the gush of blood.,ilias
As when the flocks neglected by the swainOr kids or lambs lie scatter’d o’er the plainA troop of wolves the unguarded charge surveyAnd rend the trembling unresisting prey:Thus on the foe the Greeks impetuous came;Troy fled unmindful of her former fame.,ilias
But still at Hector godlike Ajax aim’dStill pointed at his breast his javelin flamed.The Trojan chief experienced in the fieldO’er his broad shoulders spread the massy shieldObserved the storm of darts the Grecians pourAnd on his buckler caught the ringing shower:He sees for Greece the scale of conquest riseYet stops and turns and saves his loved allies.,ilias
Next on Eryalus he flies; a stoneLarge as a rock was by his fury thrown:Full on his crown the ponderous fragment flewAnd burst the helm and cleft the head in two:Prone to the ground the breathless warrior fellAnd death involved him with the shades of hell.Then low in dust Epaltes Echius lie;Ipheas Evippus Polymelus die;Amphoterus and Erymas succeed;And last Tlepolemus and Pyres bleed.Where’er he moves the growing slaughters spreadIn heaps on heaps a monument of dead.,ilias
When now Sarpedon his brave friends beheldGrovelling in dust and gasping on the fieldWith this reproach his flying host he warms:“Oh stain to honour! oh disgrace to arms!Forsake inglorious the contended plain;This hand unaided shall the war sustain:The task be mine this hero’s strength to tryWho mows whole troops and makes an army fly.”,ilias
He spake: and speaking leaps from off the car:Patroclus lights and sternly waits the war.As when two vultures on the mountain’s heightStoop with resounding pinions to the fight;They cuff they tear they raise a screaming cry;The desert echoes and the rocks reply:The warriors thus opposed in arms engageWith equal clamours and with equal rage.,ilias
Jove view’d the combat: whose event foreseenHe thus bespoke his sister and his queen:“The hour draws on; the destinies ordain245My godlike son shall press the Phrygian plain:Already on the verge of death he standsHis life is owed to fierce Patroclus’ handsWhat passions in a parent’s breast debate!Say shall I snatch him from impending fateAnd send him safe to Lycia distant farFrom all the dangers and the toils of war;Or to his doom my bravest offspring yieldAnd fatten with celestial blood the field?”,ilias
Then thus the goddess with the radiant eyes:“What words are these O sovereign of the skies!Short is the date prescribed to mortal man;Shall Jove for one extend the narrow spanWhose bounds were fix’d before his race began?How many sons of gods foredoom’d to deathBefore proud Ilion must resign their breath!Were thine exempt debate would rise aboveAnd murmuring powers condemn their partial Jove.Give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight;And when the ascending soul has wing’d her flightLet Sleep and Death convey by thy commandThe breathless body to his native land.His friends and people to his future praiseA marble tomb and pyramid shall raiseAnd lasting honours to his ashes give;His fame (’tis all the dead can have) shall live.”,ilias
The towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance:And first Sarpedon whirl’d his weighty lanceWhich o’er the warrior’s shoulder took its courseAnd spent in empty air its dying force.Not so Patroclus’ never-erring dart;Aim’d at his breast it pierced a mortal partWhere the strong fibres bind the solid heart.Then as the mountain oak or poplar tallOr pine (fit mast for some great admiral)Nods to the axe till with a groaning soundIt sinks and spreads its honours on the groundThus fell the king; and laid on earth supineBefore his chariot stretch’d his form divine:He grasp’d the dust distain’d with streaming goreAnd pale in death lay groaning on the shore.So lies a bull beneath the lion’s pawsWhile the grim savage grinds with foamy jawsThe trembling limbs and sucks the smoking blood;Deep groans and hollow roars rebellow through the wood.,ilias
“All-seeing monarch! whether Lycia’s coastOr sacred Ilion thy bright presence boastPowerful alike to ease the wretch’s smart;O hear me! god of every healing art!Lo! stiff with clotted blood and pierced with painThat thrills my arm and shoots through every veinI stand unable to sustain the spearAnd sigh at distance from the glorious war.Low in the dust is great Sarpedon laidNor Jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid;But thou O god of health! thy succour lendTo guard the relics of my slaughter’d friend:For thou though distant canst restore my mightTo head my Lycians and support the fight.”,ilias
Apollo heard; and suppliant as he stoodHis heavenly hand restrain’d the flux of blood;He drew the dolours from the wounded partAnd breathed a spirit in his rising heart.Renew’d by art divine the hero standsAnd owns the assistance of immortal hands.First to the fight his native troops he warmsThen loudly calls on Troy’s vindictive arms;With ample strides he stalks from place to place;Now fires Agenor now Polydamas:Æneas next and Hector he accosts;Inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts.,ilias
“What thoughts regardless chief! thy breast employ?Oh too forgetful of the friends of Troy!Those generous friends who from their country farBreathe their brave souls out in another’s war.See! where in dust the great Sarpedon liesIn action valiant and in council wiseWho guarded right and kept his people free;To all his Lycians lost and lost to thee!Stretch’d by Patroclus’ arm on yonder plainsO save from hostile rage his loved remains!Ah let not Greece his conquer’d trophies boastNor on his corse revenge her heroes lost!”,ilias
He spoke: each leader in his grief partook:Troy at the loss through all her legions shook.Transfix’d with deep regret they view o’erthrownAt once his country’s pillar and their own;A chief who led to Troy’s beleaguer’d wallA host of heroes and outshined them all.Fired they rush on; first Hector seeks the foesAnd with superior vengeance greatly glows.,ilias
“Heroes be men; be what you were before;Or weigh the great occasion and be more.The chief who taught our lofty walls to yieldLies pale in death extended on the field.To guard his body Troy in numbers flies;’Tis half the glory to maintain our prize.Haste strip his arms the slaughter round him spreadAnd send the living Lycians to the dead.”,ilias
The heroes kindle at his fierce command;The martial squadrons close on either hand:Here Troy and Lycia charge with loud alarmsThessalia there and Greece oppose their arms.With horrid shouts they circle round the slain;The clash of armour rings o’er all the plain.Great Jove to swell the horrors of the fightO’er the fierce armies pours pernicious nightAnd round his son confounds the warring hostsHis fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts.,ilias
Now Greece gives way and great Epigeus falls;Agacleus’ son from Budium’s lofty walls;Who chased for murder thence a suppliant cameTo Peleus and the silver-footed dame;Now sent to Troy Achilles’ arms to aidHe pays due vengeance to his kinsman’s shade.Soon as his luckless hand had touch’d the deadA rock’s large fragment thunder’d on his head;Hurl’d by Hectorean force it cleft in twainHis shatter’d helm and stretch’d him o’er the slain.,ilias
Then brave Laogonus resign’d his breathDespatch’d by Merion to the shades of death:On Ida’s holy hill he made abodeThe priest of Jove and honour’d like his god.Between the jaw and ear the javelin went;The soul exhaling issued at the vent.His spear Æneas at the victor threwWho stooping forward from the death withdrew;The lance hiss’d harmless o’er his covering shieldAnd trembling struck and rooted in the field;There yet scarce spent it quivers on the plainSent by the great Æneas’ arm in vain.“Swift as thou art (the raging hero cries)And skill’d in dancing to dispute the prizeMy spear the destined passage had it foundHad fix’d thy active vigour to the ground.”,ilias
“O valiant leader of the Dardan host!(Insulted Merion thus retorts the boast)Strong as you are ’tis mortal force you trustAn arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust.And if to this my lance thy fate be givenVain are thy vaunts; success is still from heaven:This instant sends thee down to Pluto’s coast;Mine is the glory his thy parting ghost.”,ilias
“O friend (Menoetius’ son this answer gave)With words to combat ill befits the brave;Not empty boasts the sons of Troy repelYour swords must plunge them to the shades of hell.To speak beseems the council; but to dareIn glorious action is the task of war.”,ilias
This said Patroclus to the battle flies;Great Merion follows and new shouts arise:Shields helmets rattle as the warriors close;And thick and heavy sounds the storm of blows.As through the shrilling vale or mountain groundThe labours of the woodman’s axe resound;Blows following blows are heard re-echoing wideWhile crackling forests fall on every side:Thus echoed all the fields with loud alarmsSo fell the warriors and so rung their arms.,ilias
Now great Sarpedon on the sandy shoreHis heavenly form defaced with dust and goreAnd stuck with darts by warring heroes shedLies undistinguish’d from the vulgar dead.His long-disputed corse the chiefs encloseOn every side the busy combat grows;Thick as beneath some shepherd’s thatch’d abode(The pails high foaming with a milky flood)The buzzing flies a persevering trainIncessant swarm and chased return again.,ilias
Jove view’d the combat with a stern surveyAnd eyes that flash’d intolerable day.Fix’d on the field his sight his breast debatesThe vengeance due and meditates the fates:Whether to urge their prompt effect and callThe force of Hector to Patroclus’ fallThis instant see his short-lived trophies wonAnd stretch him breathless on his slaughter’d son;Or yet with many a soul’s untimely flightAugment the fame and horror of the fight.To crown Achilles’ valiant friend with praiseAt length he dooms; and that his last of daysShall set in glory bids him drive the foe;Nor unattended see the shades below.Then Hector’s mind he fills with dire dismay;He mounts his car and calls his hosts away;Sunk with Troy’s heavy fates he sees declineThe scales of Jove and pants with awe divine.,ilias
Then nor before the hardy Lycians fledAnd left their monarch with the common dead:Around in heaps on heaps a dreadful wallOf carnage rises as the heroes fall.(So Jove decreed!) At length the Greeks obtainThe prize contested and despoil the slain.The radiant arms are by Patroclus borne;Patroclus’ ships the glorious spoils adorn.,ilias
Then thus to Phoebus in the realms aboveSpoke from his throne the cloud-compelling Jove:“Descend my Phoebus! on the Phrygian plainAnd from the fight convey Sarpedon slain;Then bathe his body in the crystal floodWith dust dishonour’d and deform’d with blood;O’er all his limbs ambrosial odours shedAnd with celestial robes adorn the dead.Those rites discharged his sacred corse bequeathTo the soft arms of silent Sleep and Death.They to his friends the immortal charge shall bear;His friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear:What honour mortals after death receiveThose unavailing honours we may give!”,ilias
Apollo bows and from mount Ida’s heightSwift to the field precipitates his flight;Thence from the war the breathless hero boreVeil’d in a cloud to silver Simois’ shore;There bathed his honourable wounds and dress’dHis manly members in the immortal vest;And with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dewsRestores his freshness and his form renews.Then Sleep and Death two twins of winged raceOf matchless swiftness but of silent paceReceived Sarpedon at the god’s commandAnd in a moment reach’d the Lycian land;The corse amidst his weeping friends they laidWhere endless honours wait the sacred shade.,ilias
Meanwhile Patroclus pours along the plainsWith foaming coursers and with loosen’d reins.Fierce on the Trojan and the Lycian crewAh blind to fate! thy headlong fury flew:Against what fate and powerful Jove ordainVain was thy friend’s command thy courage vain.For he the god whose counsels uncontroll’dDismay the mighty and confound the bold;The god who gives resumes and orders allHe urged thee on and urged thee on to fall.,ilias
Who first brave hero! by that arm was slainWho last beneath thy vengeance press’d the plain;When heaven itself thy fatal fury ledAnd call’d to fill the number of the dead?Adrestus first; Autonous then succeeds;Echeclus follows; next young Megas bleedsEpistor Melanippus bite the ground;The slaughter Elasus and Mulius crown’d:Then sunk Pylartes to eternal night;The rest dispersing trust their fates to flight.,ilias
Now Troy had stoop’d beneath his matchless powerBut flaming Phoebus kept the sacred tower.Thrice at the battlements Patroclus strook;246His blazing aegis thrice Apollo shook;He tried the fourth; when bursting from the cloudA more than mortal voice was heard aloud.,ilias
“Patroclus! cease; this heaven-defended wallDefies thy lance; not fated yet to fall;Thy friend thy greater far it shall withstandTroy shall not stoop even to Achilles’ hand.”,ilias
So spoke the god who darts celestial fires;The Greek obeys him and with awe retires.While Hector checking at the Scaean gatesHis panting coursers in his breast debatesOr in the field his forces to employOr draw the troops within the walls of Troy.Thus while he thought beside him Phoebus stoodIn Asius’ shape who reigned by Sangar’s flood;(Thy brother Hecuba! from Dymas sprungA valiant warrior haughty bold and young;)Thus he accosts him. “What a shameful sight!God! is it Hector that forbears the fight?Were thine my vigour this successful spearShould soon convince thee of so false a fear.Turn thee ah turn thee to the field of fameAnd in Patroclus’ blood efface thy shame.Perhaps Apollo shall thy arms succeedAnd heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed.”,ilias
So spoke the inspiring god; then took his flightAnd plunged amidst the tumult of the fight.He bids Cebrion drive the rapid car;The lash resounds the coursers rush to war.The god the Grecians’ sinking souls depress’dAnd pour’d swift spirits through each Trojan breast.Patroclus lights impatient for the fight;A spear his left a stone employs his right:With all his nerves he drives it at the foe.Pointed above and rough and gross below:The falling ruin crush’d Cebrion’s headThe lawless offspring of king Priam’s bed;His front brows eyes one undistinguish’d wound:The bursting balls drop sightless to the ground.The charioteer while yet he held the reinStruck from the car falls headlong on the plain.To the dark shades the soul unwilling glidesWhile the proud victor thus his fall derides.,ilias
“Good heaven! what active feats yon artist shows!What skilful divers are our Phrygian foes!Mark with what ease they sink into the sand!Pity that all their practice is by land!”,ilias
Now flaming from the zenith Sol had drivenHis fervid orb through half the vault of heaven;While on each host with equal tempests fellThe showering darts and numbers sank to hell.But when his evening wheels o’erhung the mainGlad conquest rested on the Grecian train.Then from amidst the tumult and alarmsThey draw the conquer’d corse and radiant arms.Then rash Patroclus with new fury glowsAnd breathing slaughter pours amid the foes.Thrice on the press like Mars himself he flewAnd thrice three heroes at each onset slew.There ends thy glory! there the Fates untwineThe last black remnant of so bright a line:Apollo dreadful stops thy middle way;Death calls and heaven allows no longer day!,ilias
For lo! the god in dusky clouds enshrinedApproaching dealt a staggering blow behind.The weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel;His eyes flash sparkles his stunn’d senses reelIn giddy darkness; far to distance flungHis bounding helmet on the champaign rung.Achilles’ plume is stain’d with dust and gore;That plume which never stoop’d to earth before;Long used untouch’d in fighting fields to shineAnd shade the temples of the mad divine.Jove dooms it now on Hector’s helm to nod;Not long—for fate pursues him and the god.,ilias
His spear in shivers falls; his ample shieldDrops from his arm: his baldric strows the field:The corslet his astonish’d breast forsakes:Loose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes;Stupid he stares and all-assistless stands:Such is the force of more than mortal hands!,ilias
“Lie there Patroclus! and with thee the joyThy pride once promised of subverting Troy;The fancied scenes of Ilion wrapt in flamesAnd thy soft pleasures served with captive dames.Unthinking man! I fought those towers to freeAnd guard that beauteous race from lords like thee:But thou a prey to vultures shalt be made;Thy own Achilles cannot lend thee aid;Though much at parting that great chief might sayAnd much enjoin thee this important day.,ilias
‘Return not my brave friend (perhaps he said)Without the bloody arms of Hector dead.’He spoke Patroclus march’d and thus he sped.”,ilias
“Vain boaster! cease and know the powers divine!Jove’s and Apollo’s is this deed not thine;To heaven is owed whate’er your own you callAnd heaven itself disarm’d me ere my fall.Had twenty mortals each thy match in mightOpposed me fairly they had sunk in fight:By fate and Phoebus was I first o’erthrownEuphorbus next; the third mean part thy own.But thou imperious! hear my latest breath;The gods inspire it and it sounds thy death:Insulting man thou shalt be soon as I;Black fate o’erhangs thee and thy hour draws nigh;Even now on life’s last verge I see thee standI see thee fall and by Achilles’ hand.”,ilias
He faints: the soul unwilling wings her way(The beauteous body left a load of clay)Flits to the lone uncomfortable coast;A naked wandering melancholy ghost!,ilias
“From whence this boding speech the stern decreeOf death denounced or why denounced to me?Why not as well Achilles’ fate be givenTo Hector’s lance? Who knows the will of heaven?”,ilias
Pensive he said; then pressing as he layHis breathless bosom tore the lance away;And upwards cast the corse: the reeking spearHe shakes and charges the bold charioteer.But swift Automedon with loosen’d reinsRapt in the chariot o’er the distant plainsFar from his rage the immortal coursers drove;The immortal coursers were the gift of Jove.,ilias
Menelaus upon the death of Patroclus defends his body from the enemy:Euphorbus who attempts it is slain. Hector advancing Menelausretires; but soon returns with Ajax and drives him off. This Glaucusobjects to Hector as a flight who thereupon puts on the armour he hadwon from Patroclus and renews the battle. The Greeks give way tillAjax rallies them: Æneas sustains the Trojans. Æneas and Hectorattempt the chariot of Achilles which is borne off by Automedon. Thehorses of Achilles deplore the loss of Patroclus: Jupiter covers hisbody with a thick darkness: the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion.Menelaus sends Antilochus to Achilles with the news of Patroclus’death: then returns to the fight where though attacked with theutmost fury he and Meriones assisted by the Ajaces bear off the bodyto the ships.,ilias
On the cold earth divine Patroclus spreadLies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead.Great Menelaus touch’d with generous woeSprings to the front and guards him from the foe.Thus round her new-fallen young the heifer movesFruit of her throes and first-born of her loves;And anxious (helpless as he lies and bare)Turns and re-turns her with a mother’s careOpposed to each that near the carcase cameHis broad shield glimmers and his lances flame.,ilias
The son of Panthus skill’d the dart to sendEyes the dead hero and insults the friend.“This hand Atrides laid Patroclus low;Warrior! desist nor tempt an equal blow:To me the spoils my prowess won resign:Depart with life and leave the glory mine.”,ilias
The Trojan thus: the Spartan monarch burn’dWith generous anguish and in scorn return’d:“Laugh’st thou not Jove! from thy superior throneWhen mortals boast of prowess not their own?Not thus the lion glories in his mightNor panther braves his spotted foe in fightNor thus the boar (those terrors of the plain;)Man only vaunts his force and vaunts in vain.But far the vainest of the boastful kindThese sons of Panthus vent their haughty mind.Yet ’twas but late beneath my conquering steelThis boaster’s brother Hyperenor fell;Against our arm which rashly he defiedVain was his vigour and as vain his pride.These eyes beheld him on the dust expireNo more to cheer his spouse or glad his sire.Presumptuous youth! like his shall be thy doomGo wait thy brother to the Stygian gloom;Or while thou may’st avoid the threaten’d fate;Fools stay to feel it and are wise too late.”,ilias
Unmoved Euphorbus thus: “That action knownCome for my brother’s blood repay thy own.His weeping father claims thy destined headAnd spouse a widow in her bridal bed.On these thy conquer’d spoils I shall bestowTo soothe a consort’s and a parent’s woe.No longer then defer the glorious strifeLet heaven decide our fortune fame and life.”,ilias
Swift as the word the missile lance he flings;The well-aim’d weapon on the buckler ringsBut blunted by the brass innoxious falls.On Jove the father great Atrides callsNor flies the javelin from his arm in vainIt pierced his throat and bent him to the plain;Wide through the neck appears the grisly woundProne sinks the warrior and his arms resound.The shining circlets of his golden hairWhich even the Graces might be proud to wearInstarr’d with gems and gold bestrow the shoreWith dust dishonour’d and deform’d with gore.,ilias
As the young olive in some sylvan sceneCrown’d by fresh fountains with eternal greenLifts the gay head in snowy flowerets fairAnd plays and dances to the gentle air;When lo! a whirlwind from high heaven invadesThe tender plant and withers all its shades;It lies uprooted from its genial bedA lovely ruin now defaced and dead:Thus young thus beautiful Euphorbus layWhile the fierce Spartan tore his arms away.Proud of his deed and glorious in the prizeAffrighted Troy the towering victor flies:Flies as before some mountain lion’s ireThe village curs and trembling swains retireWhen o’er the slaughter’d bull they hear him roarAnd see his jaws distil with smoking gore:All pale with fear at distance scatter’d roundThey shout incessant and the vales resound.,ilias
Meanwhile Apollo view’d with envious eyesAnd urged great Hector to dispute the prize;(In Mentes’ shape beneath whose martial careThe rough Ciconians learn’d the trade of war;)247“Forbear (he cried) with fruitless speed to chaseAchilles’ coursers of ethereal race;They stoop not these to mortal man’s commandOr stoop to none but great Achilles’ hand.Too long amused with a pursuit so vainTurn and behold the brave Euphorbus slain;By Sparta slain! for ever now suppress’dThe fire which burn’d in that undaunted breast!”,ilias
Thus having spoke Apollo wing’d his flightAnd mix’d with mortals in the toils of fight:His words infix’d unutterable careDeep in great Hector’s soul: through all the warHe darts his anxious eye; and instant view’dThe breathless hero in his blood imbued(Forth welling from the wound as prone he lay)And in the victor’s hands the shining prey.Sheath’d in bright arms through cleaving ranks he fliesAnd sends his voice in thunder to the skies:Fierce as a flood of flame by Vulcan sentIt flew and fired the nations as it went.Atrides from the voice the storm divinedAnd thus explored his own unconquer’d mind:,ilias
“Then shall I quit Patroclus on the plainSlain in my cause and for my honour slain!Desert the arms the relics of my friend?Or singly Hector and his troops attend?Sure where such partial favour heaven bestow’dTo brave the hero were to brave the god:Forgive me Greece if once I quit the field;’Tis not to Hector but to heaven I yield.Yet nor the god nor heaven should give me fearDid but the voice of Ajax reach my ear:Still would we turn still battle on the plainsAnd give Achilles all that yet remainsOf his and our Patroclus—” This no moreThe time allow’d: Troy thicken’d on the shore.A sable scene! The terrors Hector led.Slow he recedes and sighing quits the dead.,ilias
So from the fold the unwilling lion partsForced by loud clamours and a storm of darts;He flies indeed but threatens as he fliesWith heart indignant and retorted eyes.Now enter’d in the Spartan ranks he turn’dHis manly breast and with new fury burn’d;O’er all the black battalions sent his viewAnd through the cloud the godlike Ajax knew;Where labouring on the left the warrior stoodAll grim in arms and cover’d o’er with blood;There breathing courage where the god of dayHad sunk each heart with terror and dismay.,ilias
To him the king: “Oh Ajax oh my friend!Haste and Patroclus’ loved remains defend:The body to Achilles to restoreDemands our care; alas we can no more!For naked now despoiled of arms he lies;And Hector glories in the dazzling prize.”He said and touch’d his heart. The raging pairPierced the thick battle and provoke the war.Already had stern Hector seized his headAnd doom’d to Trojan gods the unhappy dead;But soon as Ajax rear’d his tower-like shieldSprung to his car and measured back the fieldHis train to Troy the radiant armour bearTo stand a trophy of his fame in war.,ilias
Meanwhile great Ajax (his broad shield display’d)Guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade;And now before and now behind he stood:Thus in the centre of some gloomy woodWith many a step the lioness surroundsHer tawny young beset by men and hounds;Elate her heart and rousing all her powersDark o’er the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours.Fast by his side the generous Spartan glowsWith great revenge and feeds his inward woes.,ilias
“Say is it just my friend that Hector’s earFrom such a warrior such a speech should hear?I deem’d thee once the wisest of thy kindBut ill this insult suits a prudent mind.I shun great Ajax? I desert my train?’Tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain;I joy to mingle where the battle bleedsAnd hear the thunder of the sounding steeds.But Jove’s high will is ever uncontroll’dThe strong he withers and confounds the bold;Now crowns with fame the mighty man and nowStrikes the fresh garland from the victor’s brow!Come through yon squadrons let us hew the wayAnd thou be witness if I fear to-day;If yet a Greek the sight of Hector dreadOr yet their hero dare defend the dead.”,ilias
Then turning to the martial hosts he cries:“Ye Trojans Dardans Lycians and allies!Be men my friends in action as in nameAnd yet be mindful of your ancient fame.Hector in proud Achilles’ arms shall shineTorn from his friend by right of conquest mine.”,ilias
He strode along the field as thus he said:(The sable plumage nodded o’er his head:)Swift through the spacious plain he sent a look;One instant saw one instant overtookThe distant band that on the sandy shoreThe radiant spoils to sacred Ilion bore.There his own mail unbraced the field bestrow’d;His train to Troy convey’d the massy load.Now blazing in the immortal arms he stands;The work and present of celestial hands;By aged Peleus to Achilles givenAs first to Peleus by the court of heaven:His father’s arms not long Achilles wearsForbid by fate to reach his father’s years.,ilias
Him proud in triumph glittering from afarThe god whose thunder rends the troubled airBeheld with pity; as apart he satAnd conscious look’d through all the scene of fate.He shook the sacred honours of his head;Olympus trembled and the godhead said;“Ah wretched man! unmindful of thy end!A moment’s glory; and what fates attend!In heavenly panoply divinely brightThou stand’st and armies tremble at thy sightAs at Achilles’ self! beneath thy dartLies slain the great Achilles’ dearer part.Thou from the mighty dead those arms hast tornWhich once the greatest of mankind had worn.Yet live! I give thee one illustrious dayA blaze of glory ere thou fad’st away.For ah! no more Andromache shall comeWith joyful tears to welcome Hector home;No more officious with endearing charmsFrom thy tired limbs unbrace Pelides’ arms!”,ilias
Then with his sable brow he gave the nodThat seals his word; the sanction of the god.The stubborn arms (by Jove’s command disposed)Conform’d spontaneous and around him closed:Fill’d with the god enlarged his members grewThrough all his veins a sudden vigour flewThe blood in brisker tides began to rollAnd Mars himself came rushing on his soul.Exhorting loud through all the field he strodeAnd look’d and moved Achilles or a god.Now Mesthles Glaucus Medon he inspiresNow Phorcys Chromius and Hippothous fires;The great Thersilochus like fury foundAsteropaeus kindled at the soundAnd Ennomus in augury renown’d.,ilias
“Hear all ye hosts and hear unnumber’d bandsOf neighbouring nations or of distant lands!’Twas not for state we summon’d you so farTo boast our numbers and the pomp of war:Ye came to fight; a valiant foe to chaseTo save our present and our future race.For this our wealth our products you enjoyAnd glean the relics of exhausted Troy.Now then to conquer or to die prepare;To die or conquer are the terms of war.Whatever hand shall win Patroclus slainWhoe’er shall drag him to the Trojan trainWith Hector’s self shall equal honours claim;With Hector part the spoil and share the fame.”,ilias
Fired by his words the troops dismiss their fearsThey join they thicken they protend their spears;Full on the Greeks they drive in firm arrayAnd each from Ajax hopes the glorious prey:Vain hope! what numbers shall the field o’erspreadWhat victims perish round the mighty dead!,ilias
Great Ajax mark’d the growing storm from farAnd thus bespoke his brother of the war:“Our fatal day alas! is come my friend;And all our wars and glories at an end!’Tis not this corse alone we guard in vainCondemn’d to vultures on the Trojan plain;We too must yield: the same sad fate must fallOn thee on me perhaps my friend on all.See what a tempest direful Hector spreadsAnd lo! it bursts it thunders on our heads!Call on our Greeks if any hear the callThe bravest Greeks: this hour demands them all.”,ilias
The warrior raised his voice and wide aroundThe field re-echoed the distressful sound.“O chiefs! O princes to whose hand is givenThe rule of men; whose glory is from heaven!Whom with due honours both Atrides grace:Ye guides and guardians of our Argive race!All whom this well-known voice shall reach from farAll whom I see not through this cloud of war;Come all! let generous rage your arms employAnd save Patroclus from the dogs of Troy.”,ilias
Oilean Ajax first the voice obey’dSwift was his pace and ready was his aid:Next him Idomeneus more slow with ageAnd Merion burning with a hero’s rage.The long-succeeding numbers who can name?But all were Greeks and eager all for fame.Fierce to the charge great Hector led the throng;Whole Troy embodied rush’d with shouts along.Thus when a mountain billow foams and ravesWhere some swoln river disembogues his wavesFull in the mouth is stopp’d the rushing tideThe boiling ocean works from side to sideThe river trembles to his utmost shoreAnd distant rocks re-bellow to the roar.,ilias
Nor less resolved the firm Achaian bandWith brazen shields in horrid circle stand.Jove pouring darkness o’er the mingled fightConceals the warriors’ shining helms in night:To him the chief for whom the hosts contendHad lived not hateful for he lived a friend:Dead he protects him with superior care.Nor dooms his carcase to the birds of air.,ilias
Once more at Ajax Hector’s javelin flies;The Grecian marking as it cut the skiesShunn’d the descending death; which hissing onStretch’d in the dust the great Iphytus’ sonSchedius the brave of all the Phocian kindThe boldest warrior and the noblest mind:In little Panope for strength renown’dHe held his seat and ruled the realms around.Plunged in his throat the weapon drank his bloodAnd deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood;In clanging arms the hero fell and allThe fields resounded with his weighty fall.,ilias
Phorcys as slain Hippothous he defendsThe Telamonian lance his belly rends;The hollow armour burst before the strokeAnd through the wound the rushing entrails broke:In strong convulsions panting on the sandsHe lies and grasps the dust with dying hands.,ilias
Struck at the sight recede the Trojan train:The shouting Argives strip the heroes slain.And now had Troy by Greece compell’d to yieldFled to her ramparts and resign’d the field;Greece in her native fortitude elateWith Jove averse had turn’d the scale of fate:But Phoebus urged Æneas to the fight;He seem’d like aged Periphas to sight:(A herald in Anchises’ love grown oldRevered for prudence and with prudence bold.),ilias
Thus he—“What methods yet O chief! remainTo save your Troy though heaven its fall ordain?There have been heroes who by virtuous careBy valour numbers and by arts of warHave forced the powers to spare a sinking stateAnd gain’d at length the glorious odds of fate:But you when fortune smiles when Jove declaresHis partial favour and assists your warsYour shameful efforts ’gainst yourselves employAnd force the unwilling god to ruin Troy.”,ilias
Æneas through the form assumed descriesThe power conceal’d and thus to Hector cries:“Oh lasting shame! to our own fears a preyWe seek our ramparts and desert the day.A god nor is he less my bosom warmsAnd tells me Jove asserts the Trojan arms.”,ilias
Greece in close order and collected mightYet suffers least and sways the wavering fight;Fierce as conflicting fires the combat burnsAnd now it rises now it sinks by turns.In one thick darkness all the fight was lost;The sun the moon and all the ethereal hostSeem’d as extinct: day ravish’d from their eyesAnd all heaven’s splendours blotted from the skies.Such o’er Patroclus’ body hung the nightThe rest in sunshine fought and open light;Unclouded there the aerial azure spreadNo vapour rested on the mountain’s headThe golden sun pour’d forth a stronger rayAnd all the broad expansion flamed with day.Dispersed around the plain by fits they fightAnd here and there their scatter’d arrows light:But death and darkness o’er the carcase spreadThere burn’d the war and there the mighty bled.,ilias
Meanwhile the sons of Nestor in the rear(Their fellows routed) toss the distant spearAnd skirmish wide: so Nestor gave commandWhen from the ships he sent the Pylian band.The youthful brothers thus for fame contendNor knew the fortune of Achilles’ friend;In thought they view’d him still with martial joyGlorious in arms and dealing death to Troy.,ilias
But round the corse the heroes pant for breathAnd thick and heavy grows the work of death:O’erlabour’d now with dust and sweat and goreTheir knees their legs their feet are covered o’er;Drops follow drops the clouds on clouds ariseAnd carnage clogs their hands and darkness fills their eyes.As when a slaughter’d bull’s yet reeking hideStrain’d with full force and tugg’d from side to sideThe brawny curriers stretch; and labour o’erThe extended surface drunk with fat and gore:So tugging round the corse both armies stood;The mangled body bathed in sweat and blood;While Greeks and Ilians equal strength employNow to the ships to force it now to Troy.Not Pallas’ self her breast when fury warmsNor he whose anger sets the world in armsCould blame this scene; such rage such horror reign’d;Such Jove to honour the great dead ordain’d.,ilias
Achilles in his ships at distance layNor knew the fatal fortune of the day;He yet unconscious of Patroclus’ fallIn dust extended under Ilion’s wallExpects him glorious from the conquered plainAnd for his wish’d return prepares in vain;Though well he knew to make proud Ilion bendWas more than heaven had destined to his friend.Perhaps to him: this Thetis had reveal’d;The rest in pity to her son conceal’d.,ilias
Still raged the conflict round the hero deadAnd heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled.“Cursed be the man (even private Greeks would say)Who dares desert this well-disputed day!First may the cleaving earth before our eyesGape wide and drink our blood for sacrifice;First perish all ere haughty Troy shall boastWe lost Patroclus and our glory lost!”,ilias
Meantime at distance from the scene of bloodThe pensive steeds of great Achilles stood:Their godlike master slain before their eyesThey wept and shared in human miseries.248In vain Automedon now shakes the reinNow plies the lash and soothes and threats in vain;Nor to the fight nor Hellespont they goRestive they stood and obstinate in woe:Still as a tombstone never to be movedOn some good man or woman unreprovedLays its eternal weight; or fix’d as standsA marble courser by the sculptor’s handsPlaced on the hero’s grave. Along their faceThe big round drops coursed down with silent paceConglobing on the dust. Their manes that lateCircled their arched necks and waved in stateTrail’d on the dust beneath the yoke were spreadAnd prone to earth was hung their languid head:Nor Jove disdain’d to cast a pitying lookWhile thus relenting to the steeds he spoke:,ilias
“Unhappy coursers of immortal strainExempt from age and deathless now in vain;Did we your race on mortal man bestowOnly alas! to share in mortal woe?For ah! what is there of inferior birthThat breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth;What wretched creature of what wretched kindThan man more weak calamitous and blind?A miserable race! but cease to mourn:For not by you shall Priam’s son be borneHigh on the splendid car: one glorious prizeHe rashly boasts: the rest our will denies.Ourself will swiftness to your nerves impartOurself with rising spirits swell your heart.Automedon your rapid flight shall bearSafe to the navy through the storm of war.For yet ’tis given to Troy to ravage o’erThe field and spread her slaughters to the shore;The sun shall see her conquer till his fallWith sacred darkness shades the face of all.”,ilias
He said; and breathing in the immortal horseExcessive spirit urged them to the course;From their high manes they shake the dust and bearThe kindling chariot through the parted war:So flies a vulture through the clamorous trainOf geese that scream and scatter round the plain.From danger now with swiftest speed they flewAnd now to conquest with like speed pursue;Sole in the seat the charioteer remainsNow plies the javelin now directs the reins:Him brave Alcimedon beheld distress’dApproach’d the chariot and the chief address’d:,ilias
“What god provokes thee rashly thus to dareAlone unaided in the thickest war?Alas! thy friend is slain and Hector wieldsAchilles’ arms triumphant in the fields.”,ilias
“In happy time (the charioteer replies)The bold Alcimedon now greets my eyes;No Greek like him the heavenly steeds restrainsOr holds their fury in suspended reins:Patroclus while he lived their rage could tameBut now Patroclus is an empty name!To thee I yield the seat to thee resignThe ruling charge: the task of fight be mine.”,ilias
He said. Alcimedon with active heatSnatches the reins and vaults into the seat.His friend descends. The chief of Troy descriedAnd call’d Æneas fighting near his side.,ilias
“Lo to my sight beyond our hope restoredAchilles’ car deserted of its lord!The glorious steeds our ready arms inviteScarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight.Can such opponents stand when we assail?Unite thy force my friend and we prevail.”,ilias
The son of Venus to the counsel yields;Then o’er their backs they spread their solid shields:With brass refulgent the broad surface shinedAnd thick bull-hides the spacious concave lined.Them Chromius follows Aretus succeeds;Each hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds:In vain brave youths with glorious hopes ye burnIn vain advance! not fated to return.,ilias
Unmov’d Automedon attends the fightImplores the Eternal and collects his might.Then turning to his friend with dauntless mind:“Oh keep the foaming coursers close behind!Full on my shoulders let their nostrils blowFor hard the fight determined is the foe;’Tis Hector comes: and when he seeks the prizeWar knows no mean; he wins it or he dies.”,ilias
Then through the field he sends his voice aloudAnd calls the Ajaces from the warring crowdWith great Atrides. “Hither turn (he said)Turn where distress demands immediate aid;The dead encircled by his friends foregoAnd save the living from a fiercer foe.Unhelp’d we stand unequal to engageThe force of Hector and Æneas’ rage:Yet mighty as they are my force to proveIs only mine: the event belongs to Jove.”,ilias
He spoke and high the sounding javelin flungWhich pass’d the shield of Aretus the young:It pierced his belt emboss’d with curious artThen in the lower belly struck the dart.As when a ponderous axe descending fullCleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull:249Struck ’twixt the horns he springs with many a boundThen tumbling rolls enormous on the ground:Thus fell the youth; the air his soul receivedAnd the spear trembled as his entrails heaved.,ilias
Now at Automedon the Trojan foeDischarged his lance; the meditated blowStooping he shunn’d; the javelin idly fledAnd hiss’d innoxious o’er the hero’s head;Deep rooted in the ground the forceful spearIn long vibrations spent its fury there.With clashing falchions now the chiefs had closedBut each brave Ajax heard and interposed;Nor longer Hector with his Trojans stoodBut left their slain companion in his blood:His arms Automedon divests and cries“Accept Patroclus this mean sacrifice:Thus have I soothed my griefs and thus have paidPoor as it is some offering to thy shade.”,ilias
So looks the lion o’er a mangled boarAll grim with rage and horrible with gore;High on the chariot at one bound he sprungAnd o’er his seat the bloody trophies hung.,ilias
Pleased to be first of all the powers address’dShe breathes new vigour in her hero’s breastAnd fills with keen revenge with fell despiteDesire of blood and rage and lust of fight.So burns the vengeful hornet (soul all o’er)Repulsed in vain and thirsty still of gore;(Bold son of air and heat) on angry wingsUntamed untired he turns attacks and stings.Fired with like ardour fierce Atrides flewAnd sent his soul with every lance he threw.,ilias
There stood a Trojan not unknown to fameAetion’s son and Podes was his name:With riches honour’d and with courage bless’dBy Hector loved his comrade and his guest;Through his broad belt the spear a passage foundAnd ponderous as he falls his arms resound.Sudden at Hector’s side Apollo stoodLike Phaenops Asius’ son appear’d the god;(Asius the great who held his wealthy reignIn fair Abydos by the rolling main.),ilias
“Oh prince! (he cried) Oh foremost once in fame!What Grecian now shall tremble at thy name?Dost thou at length to Menelaus yieldA chief once thought no terror of the field?Yet singly now the long-disputed prizeHe bears victorious while our army flies:By the same arm illustrious Podes bled;The friend of Hector unrevenged is dead!”This heard o’er Hector spreads a cloud of woeRage lifts his lance and drives him on the foe.,ilias
But now the Eternal shook his sable shieldThat shaded Ide and all the subject fieldBeneath its ample verge. A rolling cloudInvolved the mount; the thunder roar’d aloud;The affrighted hills from their foundations nodAnd blaze beneath the lightnings of the god:At one regard of his all-seeing eyeThe vanquish’d triumph and the victors fly.,ilias
Then trembled Greece: the flight Peneleus led;For as the brave Boeotian turn’d his headTo face the foe Polydamas drew nearAnd razed his shoulder with a shorten’d spear:By Hector wounded Leitus quits the plainPierced through the wrist; and raging with the painGrasps his once formidable lance in vain.,ilias
As Hector follow’d Idomen address’dThe flaming javelin to his manly breast;The brittle point before his corslet yields;Exulting Troy with clamour fills the fields:High on his chariots the Cretan stoodThe son of Priam whirl’d the massive wood.But erring from its aim the impetuous spearStruck to the dust the squire and charioteerOf martial Merion: Coeranus his nameWho left fair Lyctus for the fields of fame.On foot bold Merion fought; and now laid lowHad graced the triumphs of his Trojan foeBut the brave squire the ready coursers broughtAnd with his life his master’s safety bought.Between his cheek and ear the weapon wentThe teeth it shatter’d and the tongue it rent.Prone from the seat he tumbles to the plain;His dying hand forgets the falling rein:This Merion reaches bending from the carAnd urges to desert the hopeless war:Idomeneus consents; the lash applies;And the swift chariot to the navy flies.,ilias
Not Ajax less the will of heaven descriedAnd conquest shifting to the Trojan sideTurn’d by the hand of Jove. Then thus begunTo Atreus’s seed the godlike Telamon:,ilias
With tears the hero spoke and at his prayerThe god relenting clear’d the clouded air;Forth burst the sun with all-enlightening ray;The blaze of armour flash’d against the day.“Now now Atrides! cast around thy sight;If yet Antilochus survives the fightLet him to great Achilles’ ear conveyThe fatal news”—Atrides hastes away.,ilias
So turns the lion from the nightly foldThough high in courage and with hunger boldLong gall’d by herdsmen and long vex’d by houndsStiff with fatigue and fretted sore with wounds;The darts fly round him from a hundred handsAnd the red terrors of the blazing brands:Till late reluctant at the dawn of daySour he departs and quits the untasted preySo moved Atrides from his dangerous placeWith weary limbs but with unwilling pace;The foe he fear’d might yet Patroclus gainAnd much admonish’d much adjured his train:,ilias
“O guard these relics to your charge consign’dAnd bear the merits of the dead in mind;How skill’d he was in each obliging art;The mildest manners and the gentlest heart:He was alas! but fate decreed his endIn death a hero as in life a friend!”,ilias
So parts the chief; from rank to rank he flewAnd round on all sides sent his piercing view.As the bold bird endued with sharpest eyeOf all that wings the mid aërial skyThe sacred eagle from his walks aboveLooks down and sees the distant thicket move;Then stoops and sousing on the quivering hareSnatches his life amid the clouds of air.Not with less quickness his exerted sightPass’d this and that way through the ranks of fight:Till on the left the chief he sought he foundCheering his men and spreading deaths around:,ilias
To him the king: “Beloved of Jove! draw nearFor sadder tidings never touch’d thy ear;Thy eyes have witness’d what a fatal turn!How Ilion triumphs and the Achaians mourn.This is not all: Patroclus on the shoreNow pale and dead shall succour Greece no more.Fly to the fleet this instant fly and tellThe sad Achilles how his loved-one fell:He too may haste the naked corse to gain:The arms are Hector’s who despoil’d the slain.”,ilias
The youthful warrior heard with silent woeFrom his fair eyes the tears began to flow:Big with the mighty grief he strove to sayWhat sorrow dictates but no word found way.To brave Laodocus his arms he flungWho near him wheeling drove his steeds along;Then ran the mournful message to impartWith tearful eyes and with dejected heart.,ilias
Swift fled the youth: nor Menelaus stands(Though sore distress’d) to aid the Pylian bands;But bids bold Thrasymede those troops sustain;Himself returns to his Patroclus slain.“Gone is Antilochus (the hero said);But hope not warriors for Achilles’ aid:Though fierce his rage unbounded be his woeUnarm’d he fights not with the Trojan foe.’Tis in our hands alone our hopes remain’Tis our own vigour must the dead regainAnd save ourselves while with impetuous hateTroy pours along and this way rolls our fate.”,ilias
“’Tis well (said Ajax) be it then thy careWith Merion’s aid the weighty corse to rear;Myself and my bold brother will sustainThe shock of Hector and his charging train:Nor fear we armies fighting side by side;What Troy can dare we have already triedHave tried it and have stood.” The hero said.High from the ground the warriors heave the dead.A general clamour rises at the sight:Loud shout the Trojans and renew the fight.Not fiercer rush along the gloomy woodWith rage insatiate and with thirst of bloodVoracious hounds that many a length beforeTheir furious hunters drive the wounded boar;But if the savage turns his glaring eyeThey howl aloof and round the forest fly.Thus on retreating Greece the Trojans pourWave their thick falchions and their javelins shower:But Ajax turning to their fears they yieldAll pale they tremble and forsake the field.,ilias
The news of the death of Patroclus is brought to Achilles byAntilochus. Thetis hearing his lamentations comes with all her sea-nymphs to comfort him. The speeches of the mother and son on thisoccasion. Iris appears to Achilles by the command of Juno and ordershim to show himself at the head of the intrenchments. The sight of himturns the fortunes of the day and the body of Patroclus is carried offby the Greeks. The Trojans call a council where Hector and Polydamasdisagree in their opinions: but the advice of the former prevails toremain encamped in the field. The grief of Achilles over the body ofPatroclus.,ilias
Thetis goes to the palace of Vulcan to obtain new arms for her son. Thedescription of the wonderful works of Vulcan: and lastly that nobleone of the shield of Achilles.,ilias
The latter part of the nine-and-twentieth day and the night ensuingtake up this book: the scene is at Achilles’ tent on the sea-shorefrom whence it changes to the palace of Vulcan.,ilias
Thus like the rage of fire the combat burns250And now it rises now it sinks by turns.Meanwhile where Hellespont’s broad waters flowStood Nestor’s son the messenger of woe:There sat Achilles shaded by his sailsOn hoisted yards extended to the gales;Pensive he sat; for all that fate design’dRose in sad prospect to his boding mind.Thus to his soul he said: “Ah! what constrainsThe Greeks late victors now to quit the plains?Is this the day which heaven so long agoOrdain’d to sink me with the weight of woe?(So Thetis warn’d;) when by a Trojan handThe bravest of the Myrmidonian bandShould lose the light! Fulfilled is that decree;Fallen is the warrior and Patroclus he!In vain I charged him soon to quit the plainAnd warn’d to shun Hectorean force in vain!”,ilias
Thus while he thinks Antilochus appearsAnd tells the melancholy tale with tears.“Sad tidings son of Peleus! thou must hear;And wretched I the unwilling messenger!Dead is Patroclus! For his corse they fight;His naked corse: his arms are Hector’s right.”,ilias
A sudden horror shot through all the chiefAnd wrapp’d his senses in the cloud of grief;Cast on the ground with furious hands he spreadThe scorching ashes o’er his graceful head;His purple garments and his golden hairsThose he deforms with dust and these he tears;On the hard soil his groaning breast he threwAnd roll’d and grovell’d as to earth he grew.The virgin captives with disorder’d charms(Won by his own or by Patroclus’ arms)Rush’d from their tents with cries; and gathering roundBeat their white breasts and fainted on the ground:While Nestor’s son sustains a manlier partAnd mourns the warrior with a warrior’s heart;Hangs on his arms amidst his frantic woeAnd oft prevents the meditated blow.,ilias
“Hear me and judge ye sisters of the main!How just a cause has Thetis to complain!How wretched were I mortal were my fate!How more than wretched in the immortal state!Sprung from my bed a godlike hero cameThe bravest far that ever bore the name;Like some fair olive by my careful handHe grew he flourish’d and adorn’d the land!To Troy I sent him: but the fates ordainHe never never must return again.So short a space the light of heaven to viewSo short alas! and fill’d with anguish too!Hear how his sorrows echo through the shore!I cannot ease them but I must deplore;I go at least to bear a tender partAnd mourn my loved-one with a mother’s heart.”,ilias
She said and left the caverns of the mainAll bathed in tears; the melancholy trainAttend her way. Wide-opening part the tidesWhile the long pomp the silver wave divides.Approaching now they touch’d the Trojan land;Then two by two ascended up the strand.The immortal mother standing close besideHer mournful offspring to his sighs replied;Along the coast their mingled clamours ranAnd thus the silver-footed dame began:,ilias
“Why mourns my son? thy late preferr’d requestThe god has granted and the Greeks distress’d:Why mourns my son? thy anguish let me shareReveal the cause and trust a parent’s care.”,ilias
He deeply groaning—“To this cureless griefNot even the Thunderer’s favour brings relief.Patroclus—Ah!—say goddess can I boastA pleasure now? revenge itself is lost;Patroclus loved of all my martial trainBeyond mankind beyond myself is slain!Lost are those arms the gods themselves bestow’dOn Peleus; Hector bears the glorious load.Cursed be that day when all the powers aboveThy charms submitted to a mortal love:O hadst thou still a sister of the mainPursued the pleasures of the watery reign:And happier Peleus less ambitious ledA mortal beauty to his equal bed!Ere the sad fruit of thy unhappy wombHad caused such sorrows past and woes to come.For soon alas! that wretched offspring slainNew woes new sorrows shall create again.’Tis not in fate the alternate now to give;Patroclus dead Achilles hates to live.Let me revenge it on proud Hector’s heartLet his last spirit smoke upon my dart;On these conditions will I breathe: till thenI blush to walk among the race of men.”,ilias
“My son (coerulean Thetis made replyTo fate submitting with a secret sigh)The host to succour and thy friends to saveIs worthy thee; the duty of the brave.But canst thou naked issue to the plains?Thy radiant arms the Trojan foe detains.Insulting Hector bears the spoils on highBut vainly glories for his fate is nigh.Yet yet awhile thy generous ardour stay;Assured I meet thee at the dawn of dayCharged with refulgent arms (a glorious load)Vulcanian arms the labour of a god.”,ilias
“Ye sister Nereids! to your deeps descend;Haste and our father’s sacred seat attend;I go to find the architect divineWhere vast Olympus’ starry summits shine:So tell our hoary sire”—This charge she gave:The sea-green sisters plunge beneath the wave:Thetis once more ascends the bless’d abodesAnd treads the brazen threshold of the gods.,ilias
“Rise son of Peleus! rise divinely brave!Assist the combat and Patroclus save:For him the slaughter to the fleet they spreadAnd fall by mutual wounds around the dead.To drag him back to Troy the foe contends:Nor with his death the rage of Hector ends:A prey to dogs he dooms the corse to lieAnd marks the place to fix his head on high.Rise and prevent (if yet you think of fame)Thy friend’s disgrace thy own eternal shame!”,ilias
“I come Pelides! from the queen of JoveThe immortal empress of the realms above;Unknown to him who sits remote on highUnknown to all the synod of the sky.”“Thou comest in vain (he cries with fury warm’d);Arms I have none and can I fight unarm’d?Unwilling as I am of force I stayTill Thetis bring me at the dawn of dayVulcanian arms: what other can I wieldExcept the mighty Telamonian shield?That in my friend’s defence has Ajax spreadWhile his strong lance around him heaps the dead:The gallant chief defends Menoetius’ sonAnd does what his Achilles should have done.”,ilias
“Thy want of arms (said Iris) well we know;But though unarm’d yet clad in terrors go!Let but Achilles o’er yon trench appearProud Troy shall tremble and consent to fear;Greece from one glance of that tremendous eyeShall take new courage and disdain to fly.”,ilias
A lofty bier the breathless warrior bears:Around his sad companions melt in tears.But chief Achilles bending down his headPours unavailing sorrows o’er the deadWhom late triumphant with his steeds and carHe sent refulgent to the field of war;(Unhappy change!) now senseless pale he foundStretch’d forth and gash’d with many a gaping wound.,ilias
Meantime unwearied with his heavenly wayIn ocean’s waves the unwilling light of dayQuench’d his red orb at Juno’s high commandAnd from their labours eased the Achaian band.The frighted Trojans (panting from the warTheir steeds unharness’d from the weary car)A sudden council call’d: each chief appear’dIn haste and standing; for to sit they fear’d.’Twas now no season for prolong’d debate;They saw Achilles and in him their fate.Silent they stood: Polydamas at lastSkill’d to discern the future by the pastThe son of Panthus thus express’d his fears(The friend of Hector and of equal years;The self-same night to both a being gaveOne wise in council one in action brave):,ilias
The shouting host in loud applauses join’d;So Pallas robb’d the many of their mind;To their own sense condemn’d and left to chooseThe worst advice the better to refuse.,ilias
While the long night extends her sable reignAround Patroclus mourn’d the Grecian train.Stern in superior grief Pelides stood;Those slaughtering arms so used to bathe in bloodNow clasp his clay-cold limbs: then gushing startThe tears and sighs burst from his swelling heart.The lion thus with dreadful anguish stungRoars through the desert and demands his young;When the grim savage to his rifled denToo late returning snuffs the track of menAnd o’er the vales and o’er the forest bounds;His clamorous grief the bellowing wood resounds.So grieves Achilles; and impetuous ventsTo all his Myrmidons his loud laments.,ilias
He spoke and bade the sad attendants roundCleanse the pale corse and wash each honour’d wound.A massy caldron of stupendous frameThey brought and placed it o’er the rising flame:Then heap’d the lighted wood; the flame dividesBeneath the vase and climbs around the sides:In its wide womb they pour the rushing stream;The boiling water bubbles to the brim.The body then they bathe with pious toilEmbalm the wounds anoint the limbs with oilHigh on a bed of state extended laidAnd decent cover’d with a linen shade;Last o’er the dead the milk-white veil they threw;That done their sorrows and their sighs renew.,ilias
Meanwhile to Juno in the realms above(His wife and sister) spoke almighty Jove.“At last thy will prevails: great Peleus’ sonRises in arms: such grace thy Greeks have won.Say (for I know not) is their race divineAnd thou the mother of that martial line?”,ilias
“What words are these? (the imperial dame repliesWhile anger flash’d from her majestic eyes)Succour like this a mortal arm might lendAnd such success mere human wit attend:And shall not I the second power aboveHeaven’s queen and consort of the thundering JoveSay shall not I one nation’s fate commandNot wreak my vengeance on one guilty land?”,ilias
So they. Meanwhile the silver-footed dameReach’d the Vulcanian dome eternal frame!High-eminent amid the works divineWhere heaven’s far-beaming brazen mansions shine.There the lame architect the goddess foundObscure in smoke his forges flaming roundWhile bathed in sweat from fire to fire he flew;And puffing loud the roaring billows blew.That day no common task his labour claim’d:Full twenty tripods for his hall he framedThat placed on living wheels of massy gold(Wondrous to tell) instinct with spirit roll’dFrom place to place around the bless’d abodesSelf-moved obedient to the beck of gods:For their fair handles now o’erwrought with flowersIn moulds prepared the glowing ore he pours.Just as responsive to his thought the frameStood prompt to move the azure goddess came:Charis his spouse a grace divinely fair(With purple fillets round her braided hair)Observed her entering; her soft hand she press’dAnd smiling thus the watery queen address’d:,ilias
“What goddess! this unusual favour draws?All hail and welcome! whatsoe’er the cause;Till now a stranger in a happy hourApproach and taste the dainties of the bower.”,ilias
High on a throne with stars of silver gracedAnd various artifice the queen she placed;A footstool at her feet: then calling said“Vulcan draw near ’tis Thetis asks your aid.”“Thetis (replied the god) our powers may claimAn ever-dear an ever-honour’d name!When my proud mother hurl’d me from the sky(My awkward form it seems displeased her eye)She and Eurynome my griefs redress’dAnd soft received me on their silver breast.Even then these arts employ’d my infant thought:Chains bracelets pendants all their toys I wrought.Nine years kept secret in the dark abodeSecure I lay conceal’d from man and god:Deep in a cavern’d rock my days were led;The rushing ocean murmur’d o’er my head.Now since her presence glads our mansion sayFor such desert what service can I pay?Vouchsafe O Thetis! at our board to shareThe genial rites and hospitable fare;While I the labours of the forge foregoAnd bid the roaring bellows cease to blow.”,ilias
Then from his anvil the lame artist rose;Wide with distorted legs oblique he goesAnd stills the bellows and (in order laid)Locks in their chests his instruments of trade.Then with a sponge the sooty workman dress’dHis brawny arms embrown’d and hairy breast.With his huge sceptre graced and red attireCame halting forth the sovereign of the fire:The monarch’s steps two female forms upholdThat moved and breathed in animated gold;To whom was voice and sense and science givenOf works divine (such wonders are in heaven!)On these supported with unequal gaitHe reach’d the throne where pensive Thetis sate;There placed beside her on the shining frameHe thus address’d the silver-footed dame:,ilias
“Thee welcome goddess! what occasion calls(So long a stranger) to these honour’d walls?’Tis thine fair Thetis the command to layAnd Vulcan’s joy and duty to obey.”,ilias
To her the artist-god: “Thy griefs resignSecure what Vulcan can is ever thine.O could I hide him from the Fates as wellOr with these hands the cruel stroke repelAs I shall forge most envied arms the gazeOf wondering ages and the world’s amaze!”,ilias
Thus having said the father of the firesTo the black labours of his forge retires.Soon as he bade them blow the bellows turn’dTheir iron mouths; and where the furnace burn’dResounding breathed: at once the blast expiresAnd twenty forges catch at once the fires;Just as the god directs now loud now lowThey raise a tempest or they gently blow;In hissing flames huge silver bars are roll’dAnd stubborn brass and tin and solid gold;Before deep fix’d the eternal anvils stand;The ponderous hammer loads his better handHis left with tongs turns the vex’d metal roundAnd thick strong strokes the doubling vaults rebound.,ilias
Then first he form’d the immense and solid shield;Rich various artifice emblazed the field;Its utmost verge a threefold circle bound;253A silver chain suspends the massy round;Five ample plates the broad expanse composeAnd godlike labours on the surface rose.There shone the image of the master-mind:There earth there heaven there ocean he design’d;The unwearied sun the moon completely round;The starry lights that heaven’s high convex crown’d;The Pleiads Hyads with the northern team;And great Orion’s more refulgent beam;To which around the axle of the skyThe Bear revolving points his golden eyeStill shines exalted on the ethereal plainNor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.,ilias
Two cities radiant on the shield appearThe image one of peace and one of war.Here sacred pomp and genial feast delightAnd solemn dance and hymeneal rite;Along the street the new-made brides are ledWith torches flaming to the nuptial bed:The youthful dancers in a circle boundTo the soft flute and cithern’s silver sound:Through the fair streets the matrons in a rowStand in their porches and enjoy the show.,ilias
There in the forum swarm a numerous train;The subject of debate a townsman slain:One pleads the fine discharged which one deniedAnd bade the public and the laws decide:The witness is produced on either hand:For this or that the partial people stand:The appointed heralds still the noisy bandsAnd form a ring with sceptres in their hands:On seats of stone within the sacred place254The reverend elders nodded o’er the case;Alternate each the attesting sceptre tookAnd rising solemn each his sentence spoke.Two golden talents lay amidst in sightThe prize of him who best adjudged the right.,ilias
A field deep furrow’d next the god design’d256The third time labour’d by the sweating hind;The shining shares full many ploughmen guideAnd turn their crooked yokes on every side.Still as at either end they wheel aroundThe master meets them with his goblet crown’d;The hearty draught rewards renews their toilThen back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil:Behind the rising earth in ridges roll’d;And sable look’d though form’d of molten gold.,ilias
Another field rose high with waving grain;With bended sickles stand the reaper train:Here stretched in ranks the levell’d swarths are foundSheaves heap’d on sheaves here thicken up the ground.With sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands;The gatherers follow and collect in bands;And last the children in whose arms are borne(Too short to gripe them) the brown sheaves of corn.The rustic monarch of the field descriesWith silent glee the heaps around him rise.A ready banquet on the turf is laidBeneath an ample oak’s expanded shade.The victim ox the sturdy youth prepare;The reaper’s due repast the woman’s care.,ilias
Next ripe in yellow gold a vineyard shinesBent with the ponderous harvest of its vines;A deeper dye the dangling clusters showAnd curl’d on silver props in order glow:A darker metal mix’d intrench’d the place;And pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace.To this one pathway gently winding leadsWhere march a train with baskets on their heads(Fair maids and blooming youths) that smiling bearThe purple product of the autumnal year.To these a youth awakes the warbling stringsWhose tender lay the fate of Linus sings;In measured dance behind him move the trainTune soft the voice and answer to the strain.,ilias
Here herds of oxen march erect and boldRear high their horns and seem to low in goldAnd speed to meadows on whose sounding shoresA rapid torrent through the rushes roars:Four golden herdsmen as their guardians standAnd nine sour dogs complete the rustic band.Two lions rushing from the wood appear’d;And seized a bull the master of the herd:He roar’d: in vain the dogs the men withstood;They tore his flesh and drank his sable blood.The dogs (oft cheer’d in vain) desert the preyDread the grim terrors and at distance bay.,ilias
Next this the eye the art of Vulcan leadsDeep through fair forests and a length of meadsAnd stalls and folds and scatter’d cots between;And fleecy flocks that whiten all the scene.,ilias
A figured dance succeeds; such once was seenIn lofty Gnossus for the Cretan queenForm’d by Daedalean art; a comely bandOf youths and maidens bounding hand in hand.The maids in soft simars of linen dress’d;The youths all graceful in the glossy vest:Of those the locks with flowery wreath inroll’d;Of these the sides adorn’d with swords of goldThat glittering gay from silver belts depend.Now all at once they rise at once descendWith well-taught feet: now shape in oblique waysConfusedly regular the moving maze:Now forth at once too swift for sight they springAnd undistinguish’d blend the flying ring:So whirls a wheel in giddy circle toss’dAnd rapid as it runs the single spokes are lost.The gazing multitudes admire around:Two active tumblers in the centre bound;Now high now low their pliant limbs they bend:And general songs the sprightly revel end.,ilias
Thus the broad shield complete the artist crown’dWith his last hand and pour’d the ocean round:In living silver seem’d the waves to rollAnd beat the buckler’s verge and bound the whole.,ilias
This done whate’er a warrior’s use requiresHe forged; the cuirass that outshone the firesThe greaves of ductile tin the helm impress’dWith various sculpture and the golden crest.At Thetis’ feet the finished labour lay:She as a falcon cuts the aerial waySwift from Olympus’ snowy summit fliesAnd bears the blazing present through the skies.257,ilias
Thetis brings to her son the armour made by Vulcan. She preserves thebody of his friend from corruption and commands him to assemble thearmy to declare his resentment at an end. Agamemnon and Achilles aresolemnly reconciled: the speeches presents and ceremonies on thatoccasion. Achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain fromthe battle till the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice ofUlysses. The presents are conveyed to the tent of Achilles whereBriseis laments over the body of Patroclus. The hero obstinatelyrefuses all repast and gives himself up to lamentations for hisfriend. Minerva descends to strengthen him by the order of Jupiter. Hearms for the fight: his appearance described. He addresses himself tohis horses and reproaches them with the death of Patroclus. One ofthem is miraculously endued with voice and inspired to prophesy hisfate: but the hero not astonished by that prodigy rushes with fury tothe combat.,ilias
Soon as Aurora heaved her Orient headAbove the waves that blush’d with early red(With new-born day to gladden mortal sightAnd gild the courts of heaven with sacred light)The immortal arms the goddess-mother bearsSwift to her son: her son she finds in tearsStretch’d o’er Patroclus’ corse; while all the restTheir sovereign’s sorrows in their own express’d.A ray divine her heavenly presence shedAnd thus his hand soft touching Thetis said:,ilias
“Suppress my son this rage of grief and knowIt was not man but heaven that gave the blow;Behold what arms by Vulcan are bestow’dArms worthy thee or fit to grace a god.”,ilias
Then drops the radiant burden on the ground;Clang the strong arms and ring the shores around;Back shrink the Myrmidons with dread surpriseAnd from the broad effulgence turn their eyes.Unmoved the hero kindles at the showAnd feels with rage divine his bosom glow;From his fierce eyeballs living flames expireAnd flash incessant like a stream of fire:He turns the radiant gift: and feeds his mindOn all the immortal artist had design’d.,ilias
“Goddess! (he cried) these glorious arms that shineWith matchless art confess the hand divine.Now to the bloody battle let me bend:But ah! the relics of my slaughter’d friend!In those wide wounds through which his spirit fledShall flies and worms obscene pollute the dead?”,ilias
“That unavailing care be laid aside(The azure goddess to her son replied)Whole years untouch’d uninjured shall remainFresh as in life the carcase of the slain.But go Achilles as affairs requireBefore the Grecian peers renounce thine ire:Then uncontroll’d in boundless war engageAnd heaven with strength supply the mighty rage!”,ilias
Then in the nostrils of the slain she pour’dNectareous drops and rich ambrosia shower’dO’er all the corse. The flies forbid their preyUntouch’d it rests and sacred from decay.Achilles to the strand obedient went:The shores resounded with the voice he sent.The heroes heard and all the naval trainThat tend the ships or guide them o’er the mainAlarm’d transported at the well-known soundFrequent and full the great assembly crown’d;Studious to see the terror of the plainLong lost to battle shine in arms again.Tydides and Ulysses first appearLame with their wounds and leaning on the spear;These on the sacred seats of council placedThe king of men Atrides came the last:He too sore wounded by Agenor’s son.Achilles (rising in the midst) begun:,ilias
“O monarch! better far had been the fateOf thee of me of all the Grecian stateIf (ere the day when by mad passion sway’dRash we contended for the black-eyed maid)Preventing Dian had despatch’d her dartAnd shot the shining mischief to the heart!Then many a hero had not press’d the shoreNor Troy’s glad fields been fatten’d with our gore.Long long shall Greece the woes we caused bewailAnd sad posterity repeat the tale.But this no more the subject of debateIs past forgotten and resign’d to fate.Why should alas a mortal man as IBurn with a fury that can never die?Here then my anger ends: let war succeedAnd even as Greece has bled let Ilion bleed.Now call the hosts and try if in our sightTroy yet shall dare to camp a second night!I deem their mightiest when this arm he knowsShall ’scape with transport and with joy repose.”,ilias
He said: his finish’d wrath with loud acclaimThe Greeks accept and shout Pelides’ name.When thus not rising from his lofty throneIn state unmoved the king of men begun:,ilias
“O king of nations! whose superior sway(Returns Achilles) all our hosts obey!To keep or send the presents be thy care;To us ’tis equal: all we ask is war.While yet we talk or but an instant shunThe fight our glorious work remains undone.Let every Greek who sees my spear confoundThe Trojan ranks and deal destruction roundWith emulation what I act surveyAnd learn from thence the business of the day.”,ilias
To him the monarch: “Just is thy decreeThy words give joy and wisdom breathes in thee.Each due atonement gladly I prepare;And heaven regard me as I justly swear!Here then awhile let Greece assembled stayNor great Achilles grudge this short delay.Till from the fleet our presents be convey’dAnd Jove attesting the firm compact made.A train of noble youths the charge shall bear;These to select Ulysses be thy care:In order rank’d let all our gifts appearAnd the fair train of captives close the rear:Talthybius shall the victim boar conveySacred to Jove and yon bright orb of day.”,ilias
“For this (the stern Æacides replies)Some less important season may sufficeWhen the stern fury of the war is o’erAnd wrath extinguish’d burns my breast no more.By Hector slain their faces to the skyAll grim with gaping wounds our heroes lie:Those call to war! and might my voice inciteNow now this instant shall commence the fight:Then when the day’s complete let generous bowlsAnd copious banquets glad your weary souls.Let not my palate know the taste of foodTill my insatiate rage be cloy’d with blood:Pale lies my friend with wounds disfigured o’erAnd his cold feet are pointed to the door.Revenge is all my soul! no meaner careInterest or thought has room to harbour there;Destruction be my feast and mortal woundsAnd scenes of blood and agonizing sounds.”,ilias
“Witness thou first! thou greatest power aboveAll-good all-wise and all-surveying Jove!And mother-earth and heaven’s revolving lightAnd ye fell furies of the realms of nightWho rule the dead and horrid woes prepareFor perjured kings and all who falsely swear!The black-eyed maid inviolate removesPure and unconscious of my manly loves.If this be false heaven all its vengeance shedAnd levell’d thunder strike my guilty head!”,ilias
With that his weapon deep inflicts the wound;The bleeding savage tumbles to the ground;The sacred herald rolls the victim slain(A feast for fish) into the foaming main.,ilias
Then thus Achilles: “Hear ye Greeks! and knowWhate’er we feel ’tis Jove inflicts the woe;Not else Atrides could our rage inflameNor from my arms unwilling force the dame.’Twas Jove’s high will alone o’erruling allThat doom’d our strife and doom’d the Greeks to fall.Go then ye chiefs! indulge the genial rite;Achilles waits ye and expects the fight.”,ilias
The speedy council at his word adjourn’d:To their black vessels all the Greeks return’d.Achilles sought his tent. His train beforeMarch’d onward bending with the gifts they bore.Those in the tents the squires industrious spread:The foaming coursers to the stalls they led;To their new seats the female captives move.Briseis radiant as the queen of loveSlow as she pass’d beheld with sad surveyWhere gash’d with cruel wounds Patroclus lay.Prone on the body fell the heavenly fairBeat her sad breast and tore her golden hair;All beautiful in grief her humid eyesShining with tears she lifts and thus she cries:,ilias
“Ah youth for ever dear for ever kindOnce tender friend of my distracted mind!I left thee fresh in life in beauty gay;Now find thee cold inanimated clay!What woes my wretched race of life attend!Sorrows on sorrows never doom’d to end!The first loved consort of my virgin bedBefore these eyes in fatal battle bled:My three brave brothers in one mournful dayAll trod the dark irremeable way:Thy friendly hand uprear’d me from the plainAnd dried my sorrows for a husband slain;Achilles’ care you promised I should proveThe first the dearest partner of his love;That rites divine should ratify the bandAnd make me empress in his native land.Accept these grateful tears! for thee they flowFor thee that ever felt another’s woe!”,ilias
Her sister captives echoed groan for groanNor mourn’d Patroclus’ fortunes but their own.The leaders press’d the chief on every side;Unmoved he heard them and with sighs denied.,ilias
“If yet Achilles have a friend whose careIs bent to please him this request forbear;Till yonder sun descend ah let me payTo grief and anguish one abstemious day.”,ilias
He spoke and from the warriors turn’d his face:Yet still the brother-kings of Atreus’ race.Nestor Idomeneus Ulysses sageAnd Phoenix strive to calm his grief and rage:His rage they calm not nor his grief control;He groans he raves he sorrows from his soul.,ilias
Sighing he said: his grief the heroes join’dEach stole a tear for what he left behind.Their mingled grief the sire of heaven survey’dAnd thus with pity to his blue-eyed maid:,ilias
“Is then Achilles now no more thy careAnd dost thou thus desert the great in war?Lo where yon sails their canvas wings extendAll comfortless he sits and wails his friend:Ere thirst and want his forces have oppress’dHaste and infuse ambrosia in his breast.”,ilias
He spoke; and sudden at the word of JoveShot the descending goddess from above.So swift through ether the shrill harpy springsThe wide air floating to her ample wingsTo great Achilles she her flight address’dAnd pour’d divine ambrosia in his breast259With nectar sweet (refection of the gods!)Then swift ascending sought the bright abodes.,ilias
Now issued from the ships the warrior-trainAnd like a deluge pour’d upon the plain.As when the piercing blasts of Boreas blowAnd scatter o’er the fields the driving snow;From dusky clouds the fleecy winter fliesWhose dazzling lustre whitens all the skies:So helms succeeding helms so shields from shieldsCatch the quick beams and brighten all the fields;Broad glittering breastplates spears with pointed raysMix in one stream reflecting blaze on blaze;Thick beats the centre as the coursers bound;With splendour flame the skies and laugh the fields around,ilias
Full in the midst high-towering o’er the restHis limbs in arms divine Achilles dress’d;Arms which the father of the fire bestow’dForged on the eternal anvils of the god.Grief and revenge his furious heart inspireHis glowing eyeballs roll with living fire;He grinds his teeth and furious with delayO’erlooks the embattled host and hopes the bloody day.,ilias
The silver cuishes first his thighs infold;Then o’er his breast was braced the hollow gold;The brazen sword a various baldric tiedThat starr’d with gems hung glittering at his side;And like the moon the broad refulgent shieldBlazed with long rays and gleam’d athwart the field.,ilias
So to night-wandering sailors pale with fearsWide o’er the watery waste a light appearsWhich on the far-seen mountain blazing highStreams from some lonely watch-tower to the sky:With mournful eyes they gaze and gaze again;Loud howls the storm and drives them o’er the main.,ilias
Next his high head the helmet graced; behindThe sweepy crest hung floating in the wind:Like the red star that from his flaming hairShakes down diseases pestilence and war;So stream’d the golden honours from his headTrembled the sparkling plumes and the loose glories shed.The chief beholds himself with wondering eyes;His arms he poises and his motions tries;Buoy’d by some inward force he seems to swimAnd feels a pinion lifting every limb.,ilias
And now he shakes his great paternal spearPonderous and huge which not a Greek could rearFrom Pelion’s cloudy top an ash entireOld Chiron fell’d and shaped it for his sire;A spear which stern Achilles only wieldsThe death of heroes and the dread of fields.,ilias
Automedon and Alcimus prepareThe immortal coursers and the radiant car;(The silver traces sweeping at their side;)Their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied;The ivory-studded reins return’d behindWaved o’er their backs and to the chariot join’d.The charioteer then whirl’d the lash aroundAnd swift ascended at one active bound.All bright in heavenly arms above his squireAchilles mounts and sets the field on fire;Not brighter Phoebus in the ethereal wayFlames from his chariot and restores the day.High o’er the host all terrible he standsAnd thunders to his steeds these dread commands:,ilias
“Xanthus and Balius! of Podarges’ strain(Unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain)Be swift be mindful of the load ye bearAnd learn to make your master more your care:Through falling squadrons bear my slaughtering swordNor as ye left Patroclus leave your lord.”,ilias
The generous Xanthus as the words he saidSeem’d sensible of woe and droop’d his head:Trembling he stood before the golden wainAnd bow’d to dust the honours of his mane.When strange to tell! (so Juno will’d) he brokeEternal silence and portentous spoke.“Achilles! yes! this day at least we bearThy rage in safety through the files of war:But come it will the fatal time must comeNot ours the fault but God decrees thy doom.Not through our crime or slowness in the courseFell thy Patroclus but by heavenly force;The bright far-shooting god who gilds the day(Confess’d we saw him) tore his arms away.No—could our swiftness o’er the winds prevailOr beat the pinions of the western galeAll were in vain—the Fates thy death demandDue to a mortal and immortal hand.”,ilias
Then ceased for ever by the Furies tiedHis fateful voice. The intrepid chief repliedWith unabated rage—“So let it be!Portents and prodigies are lost on me.I know my fate: to die to see no moreMy much-loved parents and my native shore—Enough—when heaven ordains I sink in night:Now perish Troy!” He said and rush’d to fight.,ilias
Jupiter upon Achilles’ return to the battle calls a council of thegods and permits them to assist either party. The terrors of thecombat described when the deities are engaged. Apollo encourages Æneasto meet Achilles. After a long conversation these two heroesencounter; but Æneas is preserved by the assistance of Neptune.Achilles falls upon the rest of the Trojans and is upon the point ofkilling Hector but Apollo conveys him away in a cloud. Achillespursues the Trojans with a great slaughter.,ilias
Thus round Pelides breathing war and bloodGreece sheathed in arms beside her vessels stood;While near impending from a neighbouring heightTroy’s black battalions wait the shock of fight.Then Jove to Themis gives command to callThe gods to council in the starry hall:Swift o’er Olympus’ hundred hills she fliesAnd summons all the senate of the skies.These shining on in long procession comeTo Jove’s eternal adamantine dome.Not one was absent not a rural powerThat haunts the verdant gloom or rosy bower;Each fair-hair’d dryad of the shady woodEach azure sister of the silver flood;All but old Ocean hoary sire! who keepsHis ancient seat beneath the sacred deeps.On marble thrones with lucid columns crown’d(The work of Vulcan) sat the powers around.Even he whose trident sways the watery reignHeard the loud summons and forsook the mainAssumed his throne amid the bright abodesAnd question’d thus the sire of men and gods:,ilias
“What moves the god who heaven and earth commandsAnd grasps the thunder in his awful handsThus to convene the whole ethereal state?Is Greece and Troy the subject in debate?Already met the louring hosts appearAnd death stands ardent on the edge of war.”,ilias
“’Tis true (the cloud-compelling power replies)This day we call the council of the skiesIn care of human race; even Jove’s own eyeSees with regret unhappy mortals die.Far on Olympus’ top in secret stateOurself will sit and see the hand of fateWork out our will. Celestial powers! descendAnd as your minds direct your succour lendTo either host. Troy soon must lie o’erthrownIf uncontroll’d Achilles fights alone:Their troops but lately durst not meet his eyes;What can they now if in his rage he rise?Assist them gods! or Ilion’s sacred wallMay fall this day though fate forbids the fall.”He said and fired their heavenly breasts with rage.,ilias
On adverse parts the warring gods engage:Heaven’s awful queen; and he whose azure roundGirds the vast globe; the maid in arms renown’d;Hermes of profitable arts the sire;And Vulcan the black sovereign of the fire:These to the fleet repair with instant flight;The vessels tremble as the gods alight.In aid of Troy Latona Phoebus cameMars fiery-helm’d the laughter-loving dameXanthus whose streams in golden currents flowAnd the chaste huntress of the silver bow.Ere yet the gods their various aid employEach Argive bosom swell’d with manly joyWhile great Achilles (terror of the plain)Long lost to battle shone in arms again.Dreadful he stood in front of all his host;Pale Troy beheld and seem’d already lost;Her bravest heroes pant with inward fearAnd trembling see another god of war.,ilias
But when the powers descending swell’d the fightThen tumult rose: fierce rage and pale affrightVaried each face: then Discord sounds alarmsEarth echoes and the nations rush to arms.Now through the trembling shores Minerva callsAnd now she thunders from the Grecian walls.Mars hovering o’er his Troy his terror shroudsIn gloomy tempests and a night of clouds:Now through each Trojan heart he fury poursWith voice divine from Ilion’s topmost towers:Now shouts to Simois from her beauteous hill;The mountain shook the rapid stream stood still.,ilias
Above the sire of gods his thunder rollsAnd peals on peals redoubled rend the poles.Beneath stern Neptune shakes the solid ground;The forests wave the mountains nod around;Through all their summits tremble Ida’s woodsAnd from their sources boil her hundred floods.Troy’s turrets totter on the rocking plainAnd the toss’d navies beat the heaving main.Deep in the dismal regions of the dead260The infernal monarch rear’d his horrid headLeap’d from his throne lest Neptune’s arm should layHis dark dominions open to the dayAnd pour in light on Pluto’s drear abodesAbhorr’d by men and dreadful even to gods.261,ilias
Such war the immortals wage; such horrors rendThe world’s vast concave when the gods contend.First silver-shafted Phoebus took the plainAgainst blue Neptune monarch of the main.The god of arms his giant bulk display’dOpposed to Pallas war’s triumphant maid.Against Latona march’d the son of May.The quiver’d Dian sister of the day(Her golden arrows sounding at her side)Saturnia majesty of heaven defied.With fiery Vulcan last in battle standsThe sacred flood that rolls on golden sands;Xanthus his name with those of heavenly birthBut called Scamander by the sons of earth.,ilias
While thus the gods in various league engageAchilles glow’d with more than mortal rage:Hector he sought; in search of Hector turn’dHis eyes around for Hector only burn’d;And burst like lightning through the ranks and vow’dTo glut the god of battles with his blood.,ilias
Æneas was the first who dared to stay;Apollo wedged him in the warrior’s wayBut swell’d his bosom with undaunted mightHalf-forced and half-persuaded to the fight.Like young Lycaon of the royal lineIn voice and aspect seem’d the power divine;And bade the chief reflect how late with scornIn distant threats he braved the goddess-born.,ilias
Then thus the hero of Anchises’ strain:“To meet Pelides you persuade in vain:Already have I met nor void of fearObserved the fury of his flying spear;From Ida’s woods he chased us to the fieldOur force he scattered and our herds he kill’d;Lyrnessus Pedasus in ashes lay;But (Jove assisting) I survived the day:Else had I sunk oppress’d in fatal fightBy fierce Achilles and Minerva’s might.Where’er he moved the goddess shone beforeAnd bathed his brazen lance in hostile gore.What mortal man Achilles can sustain?The immortals guard him through the dreadful plainAnd suffer not his dart to fall in vain.Were God my aid this arm should check his powerThough strong in battle as a brazen tower.”,ilias
To whom the son of Jove: “That god imploreAnd be what great Achilles was before.From heavenly Venus thou deriv’st thy strainAnd he but from a sister of the main;An aged sea-god father of his line;But Jove himself the sacred source of thine.Then lift thy weapon for a noble blowNor fear the vaunting of a mortal foe.”,ilias
This said and spirit breathed into his breastThrough the thick troops the embolden’d hero press’d:His venturous act the white-arm’d queen survey’dAnd thus assembling all the powers she said:,ilias
“Behold an action gods! that claims your careLo great Æneas rushing to the war!Against Pelides he directs his coursePhoebus impels and Phoebus gives him force.Restrain his bold career; at least to attendOur favour’d hero let some power descend.To guard his life and add to his renownWe the great armament of heaven came down.Hereafter let him fall as Fates designThat spun so short his life’s illustrious line:262But lest some adverse god now cross his wayGive him to know what powers assist this day:For how shall mortal stand the dire alarmsWhen heaven’s refulgent host appear in arms?”263,ilias
Thus she; and thus the god whose force can makeThe solid globe’s eternal basis shake:“Against the might of man so feeble knownWhy should celestial powers exert their own?Suffice from yonder mount to view the sceneAnd leave to war the fates of mortal men.But if the armipotent or god of lightObstruct Achilles or commence the fightThence on the gods of Troy we swift descend:Full soon I doubt not shall the conflict end;And these in ruin and confusion hurl’dYield to our conquering arms the lower world.”,ilias
Thus having said the tyrant of the seaCoerulean Neptune rose and led the way.Advanced upon the field there stood a moundOf earth congested wall’d and trench’d around;In elder times to guard Alcides made(The work of Trojans with Minerva’s aid)What time a vengeful monster of the mainSwept the wide shore and drove him to the plain.,ilias
Here Neptune and the gods of Greece repairWith clouds encompass’d and a veil of air:The adverse powers around Apollo laidCrown the fair hills that silver Simois shade.In circle close each heavenly party satIntent to form the future scheme of fate;But mix not yet in fight though Jove on highGives the loud signal and the heavens reply.,ilias
“Lo! on the brink of fate Æneas standsAn instant victim to Achilles’ hands;By Phoebus urged; but Phoebus has bestow’dHis aid in vain: the man o’erpowers the god.And can ye see this righteous chief atoneWith guiltless blood for vices not his own?To all the gods his constant vows were paid;Sure though he wars for Troy he claims our aid.Fate wills not this; nor thus can Jove resignThe future father of the Dardan line:266The first great ancestor obtain’d his graceAnd still his love descends on all the race:For Priam now and Priam’s faithless kindAt length are odious to the all-seeing mind;On great Æneas shall devolve the reignAnd sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain.”,ilias
The great earth-shaker thus: to whom repliesThe imperial goddess with the radiant eyes:“Good as he is to immolate or spareThe Dardan prince O Neptune! be thy care;Pallas and I by all that gods can bindHave sworn destruction to the Trojan kind;Not even an instant to protract their fateOr save one member of the sinking state;Till her last flame be quench’d with her last goreAnd even her crumbling ruins are no more.”,ilias
The king of ocean to the fight descendsThrough all the whistling darts his course he bendsSwift interposed between the warrior fliesAnd casts thick darkness o’er Achilles’ eyes.267From great Æneas’ shield the spear he drewAnd at his master’s feet the weapon threw.That done with force divine he snatch’d on highThe Dardan prince and bore him through the skySmooth-gliding without step above the headsOf warring heroes and of bounding steeds:Till at the battle’s utmost verge they lightWhere the slow Caucans close the rear of fight.The godhead there (his heavenly form confess’d)With words like these the panting chief address’d:,ilias
“What power O prince! with force inferior farUrged thee to meet Achilles’ arm in war?Henceforth beware nor antedate thy doomDefrauding fate of all thy fame to come.But when the day decreed (for come it must)Shall lay this dreadful hero in the dustLet then the furies of that arm be knownSecure no Grecian force transcends thy own.”,ilias
He said: nor less elate with martial joyThe godlike Hector warm’d the troops of Troy:“Trojans to war! Think Hector leads you on;Nor dread the vaunts of Peleus’ haughty son.Deeds must decide our fate. E’en these with wordsInsult the brave who tremble at their swords:The weakest atheist-wretch all heaven defiesBut shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies.Nor from yon boaster shall your chief retireNot though his heart were steel his hands were fire;That fire that steel your Hector should withstandAnd brave that vengeful heart that dreadful hand.”,ilias
Thus (breathing rage through all) the hero said;A wood of lances rises round his headClamours on clamours tempest all the airThey join they throng they thicken to the war.But Phoebus warns him from high heaven to shunThe single fight with Thetis’ godlike son;More safe to combat in the mingled bandNor tempt too near the terrors of his hand.He hears obedient to the god of lightAnd plunged within the ranks awaits the fight.,ilias
Then fierce Achilles shouting to the skiesOn Troy’s whole force with boundless fury flies.First falls Iphytion at his army’s head;Brave was the chief and brave the host he led;From great Otrynteus he derived his bloodHis mother was a Nais of the flood;Beneath the shades of Tmolus crown’d with snowFrom Hyde’s walls he ruled the lands below.Fierce as he springs the sword his head divides:The parted visage falls on equal sides:With loud-resounding arms he strikes the plain;While thus Achilles glories o’er the slain:,ilias
“Lie there Otryntides! the Trojan earthReceives thee dead though Gygae boast thy birth;Those beauteous fields where Hyllus’ waves are roll’dAnd plenteous Hermus swells with tides of goldAre thine no more.”—The insulting hero saidAnd left him sleeping in eternal shade.The rolling wheels of Greece the body toreAnd dash’d their axles with no vulgar gore.,ilias
Hector undaunted thus: “Such words employTo one that dreads thee some unwarlike boy:Such we could give defying and defiedMean intercourse of obloquy and pride!I know thy force to mine superior far;But heaven alone confers success in war:Mean as I am the gods may guide my dartAnd give it entrance in a braver heart.”,ilias
Then parts the lance: but Pallas’ heavenly breathFar from Achilles wafts the winged death:The bidden dart again to Hector fliesAnd at the feet of its great master lies.Achilles closes with his hated foeHis heart and eyes with flaming fury glow:But present to his aid Apollo shroudsThe favour’d hero in a veil of clouds.Thrice struck Pelides with indignant heartThrice in impassive air he plunged the dart;The spear a fourth time buried in the cloud.He foams with fury and exclaims aloud:,ilias
“Wretch! thou hast ’scaped again; once more thy flightHas saved thee and the partial god of light.But long thou shalt not thy just fate withstandIf any power assist Achilles’ hand.Fly then inglorious! but thy flight this dayWhole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay.”,ilias
With that he gluts his rage on numbers slain:Then Dryops tumbled to the ensanguined plainPierced through the neck: he left him panting thereAnd stopp’d Demuchus great Philetor’s heir.Gigantic chief! deep gash’d the enormous bladeAnd for the soul an ample passage made.Laoganus and Dardanus expireThe valiant sons of an unhappy sire;Both in one instant from the chariot hurl’dSunk in one instant to the nether world:This difference only their sad fates affordThat one the spear destroy’d and one the sword.,ilias
Nor less unpitied young Alastor bleeds;In vain his youth in vain his beauty pleads;In vain he begs thee with a suppliant’s moanTo spare a form an age so like thy own!Unhappy boy! no prayer no moving artE’er bent that fierce inexorable heart!While yet he trembled at his knees and criedThe ruthless falchion oped his tender side;The panting liver pours a flood of goreThat drowns his bosom till he pants no more.,ilias
The Trojans fly before Achilles some towards the town others to theriver Scamander: he falls upon the latter with great slaughter: takestwelve captives alive to sacrifice to the shade of Patroclus; andkills Lycaon and Asteropeus. Scamander attacks him with all his waves:Neptune and Pallas assist the hero: Simois joins Scamander: at lengthVulcan by the instigation of Juno almost dries up the river. Thiscombat ended the other gods engage each other. Meanwhile Achillescontinues the slaughter drives the rest into Troy: Agenor only makes astand and is conveyed away in a cloud by Apollo; who (to deludeAchilles) takes upon him Agenor’s shape and while he pursues him inthat disguise gives the Trojans an opportunity of retiring into theircity.,ilias
Thus while he spoke the Trojan pale with fearsApproach’d and sought his knees with suppliant tearsLoth as he was to yield his youthful breathAnd his soul shivering at the approach of death.Achilles raised the spear prepared to wound;He kiss’d his feet extended on the ground:And while above the spear suspended stoodLonging to dip its thirsty point in bloodOne hand embraced them close one stopp’d the dartWhile thus these melting words attempt his heart:,ilias
“Lie there Lycaon! let the fish surroundThy bloated corpse and suck thy gory wound:There no sad mother shall thy funerals weepBut swift Scamander roll thee to the deepWhose every wave some watery monster bringsTo feast unpunish’d on the fat of kings.So perish Troy and all the Trojan line!Such ruin theirs and such compassion mine.What boots ye now Scamander’s worshipp’d streamHis earthly honours and immortal name?In vain your immolated bulls are slainYour living coursers glut his gulfs in vain!Thus he rewards you with this bitter fate;Thus till the Grecian vengeance is complete:Thus is atoned Patroclus’ honour’d shadeAnd the short absence of Achilles paid.”,ilias
These boastful words provoked the raging god;With fury swells the violated flood.What means divine may yet the power employTo check Achilles and to rescue Troy?Meanwhile the hero springs in arms to dareThe great Asteropeus to mortal war;The son of Pelagon whose lofty lineFlows from the source of Axius stream divine!(Fair Peribaea’s love the god had crown’dWith all his refluent waters circled round:)On him Achilles rush’d; he fearless stoodAnd shook two spears advancing from the flood;The flood impell’d him on Pelides’ headTo avenge his waters choked with heaps of dead.Near as they drew Achilles thus began:,ilias
“What art thou boldest of the race of man?Who or from whence? Unhappy is the sireWhose son encounters our resistless ire.”,ilias
“O son of Peleus! what avails to trace(Replied the warrior) our illustrious race?From rich Paeonia’s valleys I commandArm’d with protended spears my native band;Now shines the tenth bright morning since I cameIn aid of Ilion to the fields of fame:Axius who swells with all the neighbouring rillsAnd wide around the floated region fillsBegot my sire whose spear much glory won:Now lift thy arm and try that hero’s son!”,ilias
Threatening he said: the hostile chiefs advance;At once Asteropeus discharged each lance(For both his dexterous hands the lance could wield)One struck but pierced not the Vulcanian shield;One razed Achilles’ hand; the spouting bloodSpun forth; in earth the fasten’d weapon stood.Like lightning next the Pelean javelin flies:Its erring fury hiss’d along the skies;Deep in the swelling bank was driven the spearEven to the middle earth; and quiver’d there.Then from his side the sword Pelides drewAnd on his foe with double fury flew.The foe thrice tugg’d and shook the rooted wood;Repulsive of his might the weapon stood:The fourth he tries to break the spear in vain;Bent as he stands he tumbles to the plain;His belly open’d with a ghastly woundThe reeking entrails pour upon the ground.Beneath the hero’s feet he panting liesAnd his eye darkens and his spirit flies;While the proud victor thus triumphing saidHis radiant armour tearing from the dead:,ilias
“So ends thy glory! Such the fate they proveWho strive presumptuous with the sons of Jove!Sprung from a river didst thou boast thy line?But great Saturnius is the source of mine.How durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny?Of Peleus Æacus and Jove am I.The race of these superior far to thoseAs he that thunders to the stream that flows.What rivers can Scamander might have shown;But Jove he dreads nor wars against his son.Even Achelous might contend in vainAnd all the roaring billows of the main.The eternal ocean from whose fountains flowThe seas the rivers and the springs belowThe thundering voice of Jove abhors to hearAnd in his deep abysses shakes with fear.”,ilias
He said: then from the bank his javelin toreAnd left the breathless warrior in his gore.The floating tides the bloody carcase laveAnd beat against it wave succeeding wave;Till roll’d between the banks it lies the foodOf curling eels and fishes of the flood.All scatter’d round the stream (their mightiest slain)The amazed Paeonians scour along the plain;He vents his fury on the flying crewThrasius Astyplus and Mnesus slew;Mydon Thersilochus with Ænius fell;And numbers more his lance had plunged to hellBut from the bottom of his gulfs profoundScamander spoke; the shores return’d the sound.,ilias
“O first of mortals! (for the gods are thine)In valour matchless and in force divine!If Jove have given thee every Trojan head’Tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead.See! my choked streams no more their course can keepNor roll their wonted tribute to the deep.Turn then impetuous! from our injured flood;Content thy slaughters could amaze a god.”,ilias
In human form confess’d before his eyesThe river thus; and thus the chief replies:“O sacred stream! thy word we shall obey;But not till Troy the destined vengeance payNot till within her towers the perjured trainShall pant and tremble at our arms again;Not till proud Hector guardian of her wallOr stain this lance or see Achilles fall.”,ilias
He said; and drove with fury on the foe.Then to the godhead of the silver bowThe yellow flood began: “O son of Jove!Was not the mandate of the sire aboveFull and express that Phoebus should employHis sacred arrows in defence of TroyAnd make her conquer till Hyperion’s fallIn awful darkness hide the face of all?”,ilias
Still flies Achilles but before his eyesStill swift Scamander rolls where’er he flies:Not all his speed escapes the rapid floods;The first of men but not a match for gods.Oft as he turn’d the torrent to opposeAnd bravely try if all the powers were foes;So oft the surge in watery mountains spreadBeats on his back or bursts upon his head.Yet dauntless still the adverse flood he bravesAnd still indignant bounds above the waves.Tired by the tides his knees relax with toil;Wash’d from beneath him slides the slimy soil;When thus (his eyes on heaven’s expansion thrown)Forth bursts the hero with an angry groan:,ilias
“Is there no god Achilles to befriendNo power to avert his miserable end?Prevent O Jove! this ignominious date271And make my future life the sport of fate.Of all heaven’s oracles believed in vainBut most of Thetis must her son complain;By Phoebus’ darts she prophesied my fallIn glorious arms before the Trojan wall.Oh! had I died in fields of battle warmStretch’d like a hero by a hero’s arm!Might Hector’s spear this dauntless bosom rendAnd my swift soul o’ertake my slaughter’d friend.Ah no! Achilles meets a shameful fateOh how unworthy of the brave and great!Like some vile swain whom on a rainy dayCrossing a ford the torrent sweeps awayAn unregarded carcase to the sea.”,ilias
Neptune and Pallas haste to his reliefAnd thus in human form address’d the chief:The power of ocean first: “Forbear thy fearO son of Peleus! Lo thy gods appear!Behold! from Jove descending to thy aidPropitious Neptune and the blue-eyed maid.Stay and the furious flood shall cease to rave’Tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave.But thou the counsel heaven suggests attend!Nor breathe from combat nor thy sword suspendTill Troy receive her flying sons till allHer routed squadrons pant behind their wall:Hector alone shall stand his fatal chanceAnd Hector’s blood shall smoke upon thy lance.Thine is the glory doom’d.” Thus spake the gods:Then swift ascended to the bright abodes.,ilias
Stung with new ardour thus by heaven impell’dHe springs impetuous and invades the field:O’er all the expanded plain the waters spread;Heaved on the bounding billows danced the deadFloating ’midst scatter’d arms; while casques of goldAnd turn’d-up bucklers glitter’d as they roll’d.High o’er the surging tide by leaps and boundsHe wades and mounts; the parted wave resounds.Not a whole river stops the hero’s courseWhile Pallas fills him with immortal force.With equal rage indignant Xanthus roarsAnd lifts his billows and o’erwhelms his shores.,ilias
Then thus to Simois! “Haste my brother flood;And check this mortal that controls a god;Our bravest heroes else shall quit the fightAnd Ilion tumble from her towery height.Call then thy subject streams and bid them roarFrom all thy fountains swell thy watery storeWith broken rocks and with a load of deadCharge the black surge and pour it on his head.Mark how resistless through the floods he goesAnd boldly bids the warring gods be foes!But nor that force nor form divine to sightShall aught avail him if our rage unite:Whelm’d under our dark gulfs those arms shall lieThat blaze so dreadful in each Trojan eye;And deep beneath a sandy mountain hurl’dImmersed remain this terror of the world.Such ponderous ruin shall confound the placeNo Greeks shall e’er his perish’d relics graceNo hand his bones shall gather or inhume;These his cold rites and this his watery tomb.”,ilias
He said; and on the chief descends amainIncreased with gore and swelling with the slain.Then murmuring from his beds he boils he ravesAnd a foam whitens on the purple waves:At every step before Achilles stoodThe crimson surge and deluged him with blood.Fear touch’d the queen of heaven: she saw dismay’dShe call’d aloud and summon’d Vulcan’s aid.,ilias
“Rise to the war! the insulting flood requiresThy wasteful arm! assemble all thy fires!While to their aid by our command enjoin’dRush the swift eastern and the western wind:These from old ocean at my word shall blowPour the red torrent on the watery foeCorses and arms to one bright ruin turnAnd hissing rivers to their bottoms burn.Go mighty in thy rage! display thy powerDrink the whole flood the crackling trees devour.Scorch all the banks! and (till our voice reclaim)Exert the unwearied furies of the flame!”,ilias
The power ignipotent her word obeys:Wide o’er the plain he pours the boundless blaze;At once consumes the dead and dries the soilAnd the shrunk waters in their channel boil.As when autumnal Boreas sweeps the skyAnd instant blows the water’d gardens dry:So look’d the field so whiten’d was the groundWhile Vulcan breathed the fiery blast around.Swift on the sedgy reeds the ruin preys;Along the margin winds the running blaze:The trees in flaming rows to ashes turnThe flowering lotos and the tamarisk burnBroad elm and cypress rising in a spire;The watery willows hiss before the fire.Now glow the waves the fishes pant for breathThe eels lie twisting in the pangs of death:Now flounce aloft now dive the scaly fryOr gasping turn their bellies to the sky.At length the river rear’d his languid headAnd thus short-panting to the god he said:,ilias
“Oh Vulcan! oh! what power resists thy might?I faint I sink unequal to the fight—I yield—Let Ilion fall; if fate decree—Ah—bend no more thy fiery arms on me!”,ilias
He ceased; wide conflagration blazing round;The bubbling waters yield a hissing sound.As when the flames beneath a cauldron rise272To melt the fat of some rich sacrificeAmid the fierce embrace of circling firesThe waters foam the heavy smoke aspires:So boils the imprison’d flood forbid to flowAnd choked with vapours feels his bottom glow.To Juno then imperial queen of airThe burning river sends his earnest prayer:,ilias
“Ah why Saturnia; must thy son engageMe only me with all his wasteful rage?On other gods his dreadful arm employFor mightier gods assert the cause of Troy.Submissive I desist if thou command;But ah! withdraw this all-destroying hand.Hear then my solemn oath to yield to fateUnaided Ilion and her destined stateTill Greece shall gird her with destructive flameAnd in one ruin sink the Trojan name.”,ilias
His warm entreaty touch’d Saturnia’s ear:She bade the ignipotent his rage forbearRecall the flame nor in a mortal causeInfest a god: the obedient flame withdraws:Again the branching streams begin to spreadAnd soft remurmur in their wonted bed.,ilias
While these by Juno’s will the strife resignThe warring gods in fierce contention join:Rekindling rage each heavenly breast alarms:With horrid clangour shock the ethereal arms:Heaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound;And wide beneath them groans the rending ground.Jove as his sport the dreadful scene descriesAnd views contending gods with careless eyes.The power of battles lifts his brazen spearAnd first assaults the radiant queen of war:,ilias
“What moved thy madness thus to disuniteEthereal minds and mix all heaven in fight?What wonder this when in thy frantic moodThou drovest a mortal to insult a god?Thy impious hand Tydides’ javelin boreAnd madly bathed it in celestial gore.”,ilias
He spoke and smote the long-resounding shieldWhich bears Jove’s thunder on its dreadful field:The adamantine aegis of her sireThat turns the glancing bolt and forked fire.,ilias
Then heaved the goddess in her mighty handA stone the limit of the neighbouring landThere fix’d from eldest times; black craggy vast;This at the heavenly homicide she cast.Thundering he falls a mass of monstrous size:And seven broad acres covers as he lies.The stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound:Loud o’er the fields his ringing arms resound:The scornful dame her conquest views with smilesAnd glorying thus the prostrate god reviles:,ilias
“Hast thou not yet insatiate fury! knownHow far Minerva’s force transcends thy own?Juno whom thou rebellious darest withstandCorrects thy folly thus by Pallas’ hand;Thus meets thy broken faith with just disgraceAnd partial aid to Troy’s perfidious race.”,ilias
The goddess spoke and turn’d her eyes awayThat beaming round diffused celestial day.Jove’s Cyprian daughter stooping on the landLent to the wounded god her tender hand:Slowly he rises scarcely breathes with painAnd propp’d on her fair arm forsakes the plain.This the bright empress of the heavens survey’dAnd scoffing thus to war’s victorious maid:,ilias
“Lo! what an aid on Mars’s side is seen!The smiles’ and loves’ unconquerable queen!Mark with what insolence in open viewShe moves: let Pallas if she dares pursue.”,ilias
Minerva smiling heard the pair o’ertookAnd slightly on her breast the wanton strook:She unresisting fell (her spirits fled);On earth together lay the lovers spread.“And like these heroes be the fate of all(Minerva cries) who guard the Trojan wall!To Grecian gods such let the Phrygian beSo dread so fierce as Venus is to me;Then from the lowest stone shall Troy be moved.”Thus she and Juno with a smile approved.,ilias
Apollo thus: “To combat for mankindIll suits the wisdom of celestial mind;For what is man? Calamitous by birthThey owe their life and nourishment to earth;Like yearly leaves that now with beauty crown’dSmile on the sun; now wither on the ground.To their own hands commit the frantic sceneNor mix immortals in a cause so mean.”,ilias
Then turns his face far-beaming heavenly firesAnd from the senior power submiss retires:Him thus retreating Artemis upbraidsThe quiver’d huntress of the sylvan shades:,ilias
“And is it thus the youthful Phoebus fliesAnd yields to ocean’s hoary sire the prize?How vain that martial pomp and dreadful showOf pointed arrows and the silver bow!Now boast no more in yon celestial bowerThy force can match the great earth-shaking power.”,ilias
To her Latona hastes with tender care;Whom Hermes viewing thus declines the war:“How shall I face the dame who gives delightTo him whose thunders blacken heaven with night?Go matchless goddess! triumph in the skiesAnd boast my conquest while I yield the prize.”,ilias
He spoke; and pass’d: Latona stooping lowCollects the scatter’d shafts and fallen bowThat glittering on the dust lay here and thereDishonour’d relics of Diana’s war:Then swift pursued her to her blest abodeWhere all confused she sought the sovereign god;Weeping she grasp’d his knees: the ambrosial vestShook with her sighs and panted on her breast.,ilias
The sire superior smiled and bade her showWhat heavenly hand had caused his daughter’s woe?Abash’d she names his own imperial spouse;And the pale crescent fades upon her brows.,ilias
Thus they above: while swiftly gliding downApollo enters Ilion’s sacred town;The guardian-god now trembled for her wallAnd fear’d the Greeks though fate forbade her fall.Back to Olympus from the war’s alarmsReturn the shining bands of gods in arms;Some proud in triumph some with rage on fire;And take their thrones around the ethereal sire.,ilias
Through blood through death Achilles still proceedsO’er slaughter’d heroes and o’er rolling steeds.As when avenging flames with fury drivenOn guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven;The pale inhabitants some fall some fly;And the red vapours purple all the sky:So raged Achilles: death and dire dismayAnd toils and terrors fill’d the dreadful day.,ilias
High on a turret hoary Priam standsAnd marks the waste of his destructive hands;Views from his arm the Trojans’ scatter’d flightAnd the near hero rising on his sight!No stop no check no aid! With feeble paceAnd settled sorrow on his aged faceFast as he could he sighing quits the walls;And thus descending on the guards he calls:,ilias
“You to whose care our city-gates belongSet wide your portals to the flying throng:For lo! he comes with unresisted sway;He comes and desolation marks his way!But when within the walls our troops take breathLock fast the brazen bars and shut out death.”Thus charged the reverend monarch: wide were flungThe opening folds; the sounding hinges rung.Phoebus rush’d forth the flying bands to meet;Struck slaughter back and cover’d the retreatOn heaps the Trojans crowd to gain the gateAnd gladsome see their last escape from fate.Thither all parch’d with thirst a heartless trainHoary with dust they beat the hollow plain:And gasping panting fainting labour onWith heavier strides that lengthen toward the town.Enraged Achilles follows with his spear;Wild with revenge insatiable of war.,ilias
Then had the Greeks eternal praise acquiredAnd Troy inglorious to her walls retired;But he the god who darts ethereal flameShot down to save her and redeem her fame:To young Agenor force divine he gave;(Antenor’s offspring haughty bold and brave;)In aid of him beside the beech he sateAnd wrapt in clouds restrain’d the hand of fate.When now the generous youth Achilles spiesThick beats his heart the troubled motions rise.(So ere a storm the waters heave and roll.)He stops and questions thus his mighty soul;,ilias
He said and stood collected in his might;And all his beating bosom claim’d the fight.So from some deep-grown wood a panther startsRoused from his thicket by a storm of darts:Untaught to fear or fly he hears the soundsOf shouting hunters and of clamorous hounds;Though struck though wounded scarce perceives the pain;And the barb’d javelin stings his breast in vain:On their whole war untamed the savage flies;And tears his hunter or beneath him dies.Not less resolved Antenor’s valiant heirConfronts Achilles and awaits the warDisdainful of retreat: high held beforeHis shield (a broad circumference) he bore;Then graceful as he stood in act to throwThe lifted javelin thus bespoke the foe:,ilias
“How proud Achilles glories in his fame!And hopes this day to sink the Trojan nameBeneath her ruins! Know that hope is vain;A thousand woes a thousand toils remain.Parents and children our just arms employAnd strong and many are the sons of Troy.Great as thou art even thou may’st stain with goreThese Phrygian fields and press a foreign shore.”,ilias
The Trojans being safe within the walls Hector only stays to opposeAchilles. Priam is struck at his approach and tries to persuade hisson to re-enter the town. Hecuba joins her entreaties but in vain.Hector consults within himself what measures to take; but at theadvance of Achilles his resolution fails him and he flies. Achillespursues him thrice round the walls of Troy. The gods debate concerningthe fate of Hector; at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles.She deludes Hector in the shape of Deiphobus; he stands the combat andis slain. Achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight ofPriam and Hecuba. Their lamentations tears and despair. Their criesreach the ears of Andromache who ignorant of this was retired intothe inner part of the palace: she mounts up to the walls and beholdsher dead husband. She swoons at the spectacle. Her excess of grief andlamentation.,ilias
Thus to their bulwarks smit with panic fearThe herded Ilians rush like driven deer:There safe they wipe the briny drops awayAnd drown in bowls the labours of the day.Close to the walls advancing o’er the fieldsBeneath one roof of well-compacted shieldsMarch bending on the Greeks’ embodied powersFar stretching in the shade of Trojan towers.Great Hector singly stay’d: chain’d down by fateThere fix’d he stood before the Scaean gate;Still his bold arms determined to employThe guardian still of long-defended Troy.,ilias
Apollo now to tired Achilles turns:(The power confess’d in all his glory burns:)“And what (he cries) has Peleus’ son in viewWith mortal speed a godhead to pursue?For not to thee to know the gods is givenUnskill’d to trace the latent marks of heaven.What boots thee now that Troy forsook the plain?Vain thy past labour and thy present vain:Safe in their walls are now her troops bestow’dWhile here thy frantic rage attacks a god.”,ilias
The chief incensed—“Too partial god of day!To check my conquests in the middle way:How few in Ilion else had refuge found!What gasping numbers now had bit the ground!Thou robb’st me of a glory justly minePowerful of godhead and of fraud divine:Mean fame alas! for one of heavenly strainTo cheat a mortal who repines in vain.”,ilias
Then to the city terrible and strongWith high and haughty steps he tower’d alongSo the proud courser victor of the prizeTo the near goal with double ardour flies.Him as he blazing shot across the fieldThe careful eyes of Priam first beheld.Not half so dreadful rises to the sight274Through the thick gloom of some tempestuous nightOrion’s dog (the year when autumn weighs)And o’er the feebler stars exerts his rays;Terrific glory! for his burning breathTaints the red air with fevers plagues and death.So flamed his fiery mail. Then wept the sage:He strikes his reverend head now white with age;He lifts his wither’d arms; obtests the skies;He calls his much-loved son with feeble cries:The son resolved Achilles’ force to dareFull at the Scaean gates expects the war;While the sad father on the rampart standsAnd thus adjures him with extended hands:,ilias
He said and acting what no words could sayRent from his head the silver locks away.With him the mournful mother bears a part;Yet all her sorrows turn not Hector’s heart.The zone unbraced her bosom she display’d;And thus fast-falling the salt tears she said:,ilias
“Have mercy on me O my son! revereThe words of age; attend a parent’s prayer!If ever thee in these fond arms I press’dOr still’d thy infant clamours at this breast;Ah do not thus our helpless years foregoBut by our walls secured repel the foe.Against his rage if singly thou proceedShould’st thou (but Heaven avert it!) should’st thou bleedNor must thy corse lie honour’d on the bierNor spouse nor mother grace thee with a tear!Far from our pious rites those dear remainsMust feast the vultures on the naked plains.”,ilias
So they while down their cheeks the torrents roll;But fix’d remains the purpose of his soul;Resolved he stands and with a fiery glanceExpects the hero’s terrible advance.So roll’d up in his den the swelling snakeBeholds the traveller approach the brake;When fed with noxious herbs his turgid veinsHave gather’d half the poisons of the plains;He burns he stiffens with collected ireAnd his red eyeballs glare with living fire.Beneath a turret on his shield reclinedHe stood and question’d thus his mighty mind:275,ilias
“Unworthy sight! the man beloved of heavenBehold inglorious round yon city driven!My heart partakes the generous Hector’s pain;Hector whose zeal whole hecatombs has slainWhose grateful fumes the gods received with joyFrom Ida’s summits and the towers of Troy:Now see him flying; to his fears resign’dAnd fate and fierce Achilles close behind.Consult ye powers! (’tis worthy your debate)Whether to snatch him from impending fateOr let him bear by stern Pelides slain(Good as he is) the lot imposed on man.”,ilias
Then Pallas thus: “Shall he whose vengeance formsThe forky bolt and blackens heaven with stormsShall he prolong one Trojan’s forfeit breath?A man a mortal pre-ordain’d to death!And will no murmurs fill the courts above?No gods indignant blame their partial Jove?”,ilias
“Go then (return’d the sire) without delayExert thy will: I give the Fates their way.”Swift at the mandate pleased Tritonia fliesAnd stoops impetuous from the cleaving skies.,ilias
As through the forest o’er the vale and lawnThe well-breath’d beagle drives the flying fawnIn vain he tries the covert of the brakesOr deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes;Sure of the vapour in the tainted dewsThe certain hound his various maze pursues.Thus step by step where’er the Trojan wheel’dThere swift Achilles compass’d round the field.Oft as to reach the Dardan gates he bendsAnd hopes the assistance of his pitying friends(Whose showering arrows as he coursed belowFrom the high turrets might oppress the foe)So oft Achilles turns him to the plain:He eyes the city but he eyes in vain.As men in slumbers seem with speedy paceOne to pursue and one to lead the chaseTheir sinking limbs the fancied course forsakeNor this can fly nor that can overtake:No less the labouring heroes pant and strain:While that but flies and this pursues in vain.,ilias
What god O muse assisted Hector’s forceWith fate itself so long to hold the course?Phoebus it was; who in his latest hourEndued his knees with strength his nerves with power:And great Achilles lest some Greek’s advanceShould snatch the glory from his lifted lanceSign’d to the troops to yield his foe the wayAnd leave untouch’d the honours of the day.,ilias
Jove lifts the golden balances that showThe fates of mortal men and things below:Here each contending hero’s lot he triesAnd weighs with equal hand their destinies.Low sinks the scale surcharged with Hector’s fate;Heavy with death it sinks and hell receives the weight.,ilias
Then Phoebus left him. Fierce Minerva fliesTo stern Pelides and triumphing cries:“O loved of Jove! this day our labours ceaseAnd conquest blazes with full beams on Greece.Great Hector falls; that Hector famed so farDrunk with renown insatiable of warFalls by thy hand and mine! nor force nor flightShall more avail him nor his god of light.See where in vain he supplicates aboveRoll’d at the feet of unrelenting Jove;Rest here: myself will lead the Trojan onAnd urge to meet the fate he cannot shun.”,ilias
Her voice divine the chief with joyful mindObey’d; and rested on his lance reclinedWhile like Deiphobus the martial dame(Her face her gesture and her arms the same)In show an aid by hapless Hector’s sideApproach’d and greets him thus with voice belied:,ilias
“Too long O Hector! have I borne the sightOf this distress and sorrow’d in thy flight:It fits us now a noble stand to makeAnd here as brothers equal fates partake.”,ilias
Then he: “O prince! allied in blood and fameDearer than all that own a brother’s name;Of all that Hecuba to Priam boreLong tried long loved: much loved but honoured more!Since you of all our numerous race aloneDefend my life regardless of your own.”,ilias
Again the goddess: “Much my father’s prayerAnd much my mother’s press’d me to forbear:My friends embraced my knees adjured my stayBut stronger love impell’d and I obey.Come then the glorious conflict let us tryLet the steel sparkle and the javelin fly;Or let us stretch Achilles on the fieldOr to his arm our bloody trophies yield.”,ilias
Fraudful she said; then swiftly march’d before:The Dardan hero shuns his foe no more.Sternly they met. The silence Hector broke:His dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke:,ilias
“Enough O son of Peleus! Troy has view’dHer walls thrice circled and her chief pursued.But now some god within me bids me tryThine or my fate: I kill thee or I die.Yet on the verge of battle let us stayAnd for a moment’s space suspend the day;Let Heaven’s high powers be call’d to arbitrateThe just conditions of this stern debate(Eternal witnesses of all belowAnd faithful guardians of the treasured vow!)To them I swear; if victor in the strifeJove by these hands shall shed thy noble lifeNo vile dishonour shall thy corse pursue;Stripp’d of its arms alone (the conqueror’s due)The rest to Greece uninjured I’ll restore:Now plight thy mutual oath I ask no more.”,ilias
“Talk not of oaths (the dreadful chief repliesWhile anger flash’d from his disdainful eyes)Detested as thou art and ought to beNor oath nor pact Achilles plights with thee:Such pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combineSuch leagues as men and furious lions joinTo such I call the gods! one constant stateOf lasting rancour and eternal hate:No thought but rage and never-ceasing strifeTill death extinguish rage and thought and life.Rouse then thy forces this important hourCollect thy soul and call forth all thy power.No further subterfuge no further chance;’Tis Pallas Pallas gives thee to my lance.Each Grecian ghost by thee deprived of breathNow hovers round and calls thee to thy death.”,ilias
He spoke and launch’d his javelin at the foe;But Hector shunn’d the meditated blow:He stoop’d while o’er his head the flying spearSang innocent and spent its force in air.Minerva watch’d it falling on the landThen drew and gave to great Achilles’ handUnseen of Hector who elate with joyNow shakes his lance and braves the dread of Troy.,ilias
“The life you boasted to that javelin givenPrince! you have miss’d. My fate depends on HeavenTo thee presumptuous as thou art unknownOr what must prove my fortune or thy own.Boasting is but an art our fears to blindAnd with false terrors sink another’s mind.But know whatever fate I am to tryBy no dishonest wound shall Hector die.I shall not fall a fugitive at leastMy soul shall bravely issue from my breast.But first try thou my arm; and may this dartEnd all my country’s woes deep buried in thy heart.”,ilias
The weapon flew its course unerring heldUnerring but the heavenly shield repell’dThe mortal dart; resulting with a boundFrom off the ringing orb it struck the ground.Hector beheld his javelin fall in vainNor other lance nor other hope remain;He calls Deiphobus demands a spear—In vain for no Deiphobus was there.All comfortless he stands: then with a sigh;“’Tis so—Heaven wills it and my hour is nigh!I deem’d Deiphobus had heard my callBut he secure lies guarded in the wall.A god deceived me; Pallas ’twas thy deedDeath and black fate approach! ’tis I must bleed.No refuge now no succour from aboveGreat Jove deserts me and the son of JovePropitious once and kind! Then welcome fate!’Tis true I perish yet I perish great:Yet in a mighty deed I shall expireLet future ages hear it and admire!”,ilias
“At last is Hector stretch’d upon the plainWho fear’d no vengeance for Patroclus slain:Then prince! you should have fear’d what now you feel;Achilles absent was Achilles still:Yet a short space the great avenger stayedThen low in dust thy strength and glory laid.Peaceful he sleeps with all our rites adorn’dFor ever honour’d and for ever mourn’d:While cast to all the rage of hostile powerThee birds shall mangle and the gods devour.”,ilias
Then Hector fainting at the approach of death:“By thy own soul! by those who gave thee breath!By all the sacred prevalence of prayer;Ah leave me not for Grecian dogs to tear!The common rites of sepulture bestowTo soothe a father’s and a mother’s woe:Let their large gifts procure an urn at leastAnd Hector’s ashes in his country rest.”,ilias
“No wretch accursed! relentless he replies;(Flames as he spoke shot flashing from his eyes;)Not those who gave me breath should bid me spareNor all the sacred prevalence of prayer.Could I myself the bloody banquet join!No—to the dogs that carcase I resign.Should Troy to bribe me bring forth all her storeAnd giving thousands offer thousands more;Should Dardan Priam and his weeping dameDrain their whole realm to buy one funeral flame:Their Hector on the pile they should not seeNor rob the vultures of one limb of thee.”,ilias
Then thus the chief his dying accents drew:“Thy rage implacable! too well I knew:The Furies that relentless breast have steel’dAnd cursed thee with a heart that cannot yield.Yet think a day will come when fate’s decreeAnd angry gods shall wreak this wrong on thee;Phoebus and Paris shall avenge my fateAnd stretch thee here before the Scaean gate.”278,ilias
He ceased. The Fates suppress’d his labouring breathAnd his eyes stiffen’d at the hand of death;To the dark realm the spirit wings its way(The manly body left a load of clay)And plaintive glides along the dreary coastA naked wandering melancholy ghost!,ilias
Achilles musing as he roll’d his eyesO’er the dead hero thus unheard replies:“Die thou the first! When Jove and heaven ordainI follow thee”—He said and stripp’d the slain.Then forcing backward from the gaping woundThe reeking javelin cast it on the ground.The thronging Greeks behold with wondering eyesHis manly beauty and superior size;While some ignobler the great dead defaceWith wounds ungenerous or with taunts disgrace:,ilias
Then his fell soul a thought of vengeance bred;(Unworthy of himself and of the dead;)The nervous ancles bored his feet he boundWith thongs inserted through the double wound;These fix’d up high behind the rolling wainHis graceful head was trail’d along the plain.Proud on his car the insulting victor stoodAnd bore aloft his arms distilling blood.He smites the steeds; the rapid chariot flies;The sudden clouds of circling dust arise.Now lost is all that formidable air;The face divine and long-descending hairPurple the ground and streak the sable sand;Deform’d dishonour’d in his native landGiven to the rage of an insulting throngAnd in his parents’ sight now dragg’d along!,ilias
Amidst her matrons Hecuba appears:(A mourning princess and a train in tears;)“Ah why has Heaven prolong’d this hated breathPatient of horrors to behold thy death?O Hector! late thy parents’ pride and joyThe boast of nations! the defence of Troy!To whom her safety and her fame she owed;Her chief her hero and almost her god!O fatal change! become in one sad dayA senseless corse! inanimated clay!”,ilias
But not as yet the fatal news had spreadTo fair Andromache of Hector dead;As yet no messenger had told his fateNot e’en his stay without the Scaean gate.Far in the close recesses of the domePensive she plied the melancholy loom;A growing work employ’d her secret hoursConfusedly gay with intermingled flowers.Her fair-haired handmaids heat the brazen urnThe bath preparing for her lord’s returnIn vain; alas! her lord returns no more;Unbathed he lies and bleeds along the shore!Now from the walls the clamours reach her earAnd all her members shake with sudden fear:Forth from her ivory hand the shuttle fallsAnd thus astonish’d to her maids she calls:,ilias
“Ah follow me! (she cried) what plaintive noiseInvades my ear? ’Tis sure my mother’s voice.My faltering knees their trembling frame desertA pulse unusual flutters at my heart;Some strange disaster some reverse of fate(Ye gods avert it!) threats the Trojan state.Far be the omen which my thoughts suggest!But much I fear my Hector’s dauntless breastConfronts Achilles; chased along the plainShut from our walls! I fear I fear him slain!Safe in the crowd he ever scorn’d to waitAnd sought for glory in the jaws of fate:Perhaps that noble heat has cost his breathNow quench’d for ever in the arms of death.”,ilias
She spoke: and furious with distracted paceFears in her heart and anguish in her faceFlies through the dome (the maids her steps pursue)And mounts the walls and sends around her view.Too soon her eyes the killing object foundThe godlike Hector dragg’d along the ground.A sudden darkness shades her swimming eyes:She faints she falls; her breath her colour flies.Her hair’s fair ornaments the braids that boundThe net that held them and the wreath that crown’dThe veil and diadem flew far away(The gift of Venus on her bridal day).Around a train of weeping sisters standsTo raise her sinking with assistant hands.Scarce from the verge of death recall’d againShe faints or but recovers to complain.,ilias
Achilles and the Myrmidons do honours to the body of Patroclus. Afterthe funeral feast he retires to the sea-shore where falling asleepthe ghost of his friend appears to him and demands the rites ofburial; the next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggonsto fetch wood for the pyre. The funeral procession and the offeringtheir hair to the dead. Achilles sacrifices several animals and lastlytwelve Trojan captives at the pile; then sets fire to it. He payslibations to the Winds which (at the instance of Iris) rise and raisethe flames. When the pile has burned all night they gather the bonesplace them in an urn of gold and raise the tomb. Achilles institutesthe funeral games: the chariot-race the fight of the caestus thewrestling the foot-race the single combat the discus the shootingwith arrows the darting the javelin: the various descriptions ofwhich and the various success of the several antagonists make thegreatest part of the book.,ilias
In this book ends the thirtieth day. The night following the ghost ofPatroclus appears to Achilles: the one-and-thirtieth day is employed infelling the timber for the pile: the two-and-thirtieth in burning it;and the three-and-thirtieth in the games. The scene is generally on thesea-shore.,ilias
Thus humbled in the dust the pensive trainThrough the sad city mourn’d her hero slain.The body soil’d with dust and black with goreLies on broad Hellespont’s resounding shore.The Grecians seek their ships and clear the strandAll but the martial Myrmidonian band:These yet assembled great Achilles holdsAnd the stern purpose of his mind unfolds:,ilias
“Not yet my brave companions of the warRelease your smoking coursers from the car;But with his chariot each in order ledPerform due honours to Patroclus dead.Ere yet from rest or food we seek reliefSome rites remain to glut our rage of grief.”,ilias
The troops obey’d; and thrice in order led281(Achilles first) their coursers round the dead;And thrice their sorrows and laments renew;Tears bathe their arms and tears the sands bedew.For such a warrior Thetis aids their woeMelts their strong hearts and bids their eyes to flow.But chief Pelides: thick-succeeding sighsBurst from his heart and torrents from his eyes:His slaughtering hands yet red with blood he laidOn his dead friend’s cold breast and thus he said:,ilias
“All hail Patroclus! let thy honour’d ghostHear and rejoice on Pluto’s dreary coast;Behold! Achilles’ promise is complete;The bloody Hector stretch’d before thy feet.Lo! to the dogs his carcase I resign;And twelve sad victims of the Trojan lineSacred to vengeance instant shall expire;Their lives effused around thy funeral pyre.”,ilias
Gloomy he said and (horrible to view)Before the bier the bleeding Hector threwProne on the dust. The Myrmidons aroundUnbraced their armour and the steeds unbound.All to Achilles’ sable ship repairFrequent and full the genial feast to share.Now from the well-fed swine black smokes aspireThe bristly victims hissing o’er the fire:The huge ox bellowing falls; with feebler criesExpires the goat; the sheep in silence dies.Around the hero’s prostrate body flow’dIn one promiscuous stream the reeking blood.And now a band of Argive monarchs bringsThe glorious victor to the king of kings.From his dead friend the pensive warrior wentWith steps unwilling to the regal tent.The attending heralds as by office boundWith kindled flames the tripod-vase surround:To cleanse his conquering hands from hostile goreThey urged in vain; the chief refused and swore:282,ilias
“No drop shall touch me by almighty Jove!The first and greatest of the gods above!Till on the pyre I place thee; till I rearThe grassy mound and clip thy sacred hair.Some ease at least those pious rites may giveAnd soothe my sorrows while I bear to live.Howe’er reluctant as I am I stayAnd share your feast; but with the dawn of day(O king of men!) it claims thy royal careThat Greece the warrior’s funeral pile prepareAnd bid the forests fall: (such rites are paidTo heroes slumbering in eternal shade:)Then when his earthly part shall mount in fireLet the leagued squadrons to their posts retire.”,ilias
“And is it thou? (he answers) To my sight283Once more return’st thou from the realms of night?O more than brother! Think each office paidWhate’er can rest a discontented shade;But grant one last embrace unhappy boy!Afford at least that melancholy joy.”,ilias
He said and with his longing arms essay’dIn vain to grasp the visionary shade!Like a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly284And hears a feeble lamentable cry.Confused he wakes; amazement breaks the bandsOf golden sleep and starting from the sandsPensive he muses with uplifted hands:,ilias
“’Tis true ’tis certain; man though dead retainsPart of himself; the immortal mind remains:The form subsists without the body’s aidAerial semblance and an empty shade!This night my friend so late in battle lostStood at my side a pensive plaintive ghost:Even now familiar as in life he came;Alas! how different! yet how like the same!”,ilias
“Sperchius! whose waves in mazy errors lostDelightful roll along my native coast!To whom we vainly vow’d at our returnThese locks to fall and hecatombs to burn:Full fifty rams to bleed in sacrificeWhere to the day thy silver fountains riseAnd where in shade of consecrated bowersThy altars stand perfumed with native flowers!So vow’d my father but he vow’d in vain;No more Achilles sees his native plain;In that vain hope these hairs no longer growPatroclus bears them to the shades below.”,ilias
“All hail Patroclus! let thy vengeful ghostHear and exult on Pluto’s dreary coast.Behold Achilles’ promise fully paidTwelve Trojan heroes offer’d to thy shade;But heavier fates on Hector’s corse attendSaved from the flames for hungry dogs to rend.”,ilias
So spake he threatening: but the gods made vainHis threat and guard inviolate the slain:Celestial Venus hover’d o’er his headAnd roseate unguents heavenly fragrance! shed:She watch’d him all the night and all the dayAnd drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey.Nor sacred Phoebus less employ’d his care;He pour’d around a veil of gather’d airAnd kept the nerves undried the flesh entireAgainst the solar beam and Sirian fire.,ilias
Then parting from the pile he ceased to weepAnd sank to quiet in the embrace of sleepExhausted with his grief: meanwhile the crowdOf thronging Grecians round Achilles stood;The tumult waked him: from his eyes he shookUnwilling slumber and the chiefs bespoke:,ilias
“Ye kings and princes of the Achaian name!First let us quench the yet remaining flameWith sable wine; then as the rites directThe hero’s bones with careful view select:(Apart and easy to be known they lieAmidst the heap and obvious to the eye:The rest around the margin will be seenPromiscuous steeds and immolated men:)These wrapp’d in double cauls of fat prepare;And in the golden vase dispose with care;There let them rest with decent honour laidTill I shall follow to the infernal shade.Meantime erect the tomb with pious handsA common structure on the humble sands:Hereafter Greece some nobler work may raiseAnd late posterity record our praise!”,ilias
The Greeks obey; where yet the embers glowWide o’er the pile the sable wine they throwAnd deep subsides the ashy heap below.Next the white bones his sad companions placeWith tears collected in the golden vase.The sacred relics to the tent they bore;The urn a veil of linen covered o’er.That done they bid the sepulchre aspireAnd cast the deep foundations round the pyre;High in the midst they heap the swelling bedOf rising earth memorial of the dead.,ilias
The swarming populace the chief detainsAnd leads amidst a wide extent of plains;There placed them round: then from the ships proceedsA train of oxen mules and stately steedsVases and tripods (for the funeral games)Resplendent brass and more resplendent dames.First stood the prizes to reward the forceOf rapid racers in the dusty course:A woman for the first in beauty’s bloomSkill’d in the needle and the labouring loom;And a large vase where two bright handles riseOf twenty measures its capacious size.The second victor claims a mare unbrokeBig with a mule unknowing of the yoke:The third a charger yet untouch’d by flame;Four ample measures held the shining frame:Two golden talents for the fourth were placed:An ample double bowl contents the last.These in fair order ranged upon the plainThe hero rising thus address’d the train:,ilias
“Behold the prizes valiant Greeks! decreedTo the brave rulers of the racing steed;Prizes which none beside ourself could gainShould our immortal coursers take the plain;(A race unrivall’d which from ocean’s godPeleus received and on his son bestow’d.)But this no time our vigour to display;Nor suit with them the games of this sad day:Lost is Patroclus now that wont to deckTheir flowing manes and sleek their glossy neck.Sad as they shared in human grief they standAnd trail those graceful honours on the sand!Let others for the noble task prepareWho trust the courser and the flying car.”,ilias
Fired at his word the rival racers rise;But far the first Eumelus hopes the prizeFamed though Pieria for the fleetest breedAnd skill’d to manage the high-bounding steed.With equal ardour bold Tydides swell’dThe steeds of Tros beneath his yoke compell’d(Which late obey’d the Dardan chief’s commandWhen scarce a god redeem’d him from his hand).Then Menelaus his Podargus bringsAnd the famed courser of the king of kings:Whom rich Echepolus (more rich than brave)To ’scape the wars to Agamemnon gave(Æthe her name) at home to end his days;Base wealth preferring to eternal praise.Next him Antilochus demands the courseWith beating heart and cheers his Pylian horse.Experienced Nestor gives his son the reinsDirects his judgment and his heat restrains;Nor idly warns the hoary sire nor hearsThe prudent son with unattending ears.,ilias
The next though distant Menelaus succeeds;While thus young Nestor animates his steeds:“Now now my generous pair exert your force;Not that we hope to match Tydides’ horseSince great Minerva wings their rapid wayAnd gives their lord the honours of the day;But reach Atrides! shall his mare outgoYour swiftness? vanquish’d by a female foe?Through your neglect if lagging on the plainThe last ignoble gift be all we gainNo more shall Nestor’s hand your food supplyThe old man’s fury rises and ye die.Haste then: yon narrow road before our sightPresents the occasion could we use it right.”,ilias
“Old man! (Oileus rashly thus replies)Thy tongue too hastily confers the prize;Of those who view the course nor sharpest eyedNor youngest yet the readiest to decide.Eumelus’ steeds high bounding in the chaseStill as at first unrivall’d lead the race:I well discern him as he shakes the reinAnd hear his shouts victorious o’er the plain.”,ilias
Thus he. Idomeneus incensed rejoin’d:“Barbarous of words! and arrogant of mind!Contentious prince of all the Greeks besideThe last in merit as the first in pride!To vile reproach what answer can we make?A goblet or a tripod let us stakeAnd be the king the judge. The most unwiseWill learn their rashness when they pay the price.”,ilias
He said: and Ajax by mad passion borneStern had replied; fierce scorn enhancing scornTo fell extremes. But Thetis’ godlike sonAwful amidst them rose and thus begun:,ilias
“Forbear ye chiefs! reproachful to contend;Much would ye blame should others thus offend:And lo! the approaching steeds your contest end.”No sooner had he spoke but thundering nearDrives through a stream of dust the charioteer.High o’er his head the circling lash he wields:His bounding horses scarcely touch the fields:His car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll’dBright with the mingled blaze of tin and goldRefulgent through the cloud: no eye could findThe track his flying wheels had left behind:And the fierce coursers urged their rapid paceSo swift it seem’d a flight and not a race.Now victor at the goal Tydides standsQuits his bright car and springs upon the sands;From the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream;The well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam:With joy brave Sthenelus receives the prizeThe tripod-vase and dame with radiant eyes:These to the ships his train triumphant leadsThe chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.,ilias
Young Nestor follows (who by art not forceO’erpass’d Atrides) second in the course.Behind Atrides urged the race more nearThan to the courser in his swift careerThe following car just touching with his heelAnd brushing with his tail the whirling wheel:Such and so narrow now the space betweenThe rivals late so distant on the green;So soon swift Æthe her lost ground regain’dOne length one moment had the race obtain’d.,ilias
Merion pursued at greater distance stillWith tardier coursers and inferior skill.Last came Admetus! thy unhappy son;Slow dragged the steeds his batter’d chariot on:Achilles saw and pitying thus begun:,ilias
“Behold! the man whose matchless art surpass’dThe sons of Greece! the ablest yet the last!Fortune denies but justice bids us pay(Since great Tydides bears the first away)To him the second honours of the day.”,ilias
The Greeks consent with loud-applauding criesAnd then Eumelus had received the prizeBut youthful Nestor jealous of his fameThe award opposes and asserts his claim.“Think not (he cries) I tamely will resignO Peleus’ son! the mare so justly mine.What if the gods the skilful to confoundHave thrown the horse and horseman to the ground?Perhaps he sought not heaven by sacrificeAnd vows omitted forfeited the prize.If yet (distinction to thy friend to showAnd please a soul desirous to bestow)Some gift must grace Eumelus view thy storeOf beauteous handmaids steeds and shining ore;An ample present let him thence receiveAnd Greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give.But this my prize I never shall forego;This who but touches warriors! is my foe.”,ilias
Thus spake the youth; nor did his words offend;Pleased with the well-turn’d flattery of a friendAchilles smiled: “The gift proposed (he cried)Antilochus! we shall ourself provide.With plates of brass the corslet cover’d o’er(The same renown’d Asteropaeus wore)Whose glittering margins raised with silver shine(No vulgar gift) Eumelus! shall be thine.”,ilias
He said: Automedon at his commandThe corslet brought and gave it to his hand.Distinguish’d by his friend his bosom glowsWith generous joy: then Menelaus rose;The herald placed the sceptre in his handsAnd still’d the clamour of the shouting bands.Not without cause incensed at Nestor’s sonAnd inly grieving thus the king begun:,ilias
“The praise of wisdom in thy youth obtain’dAn act so rash Antilochus! has stain’d.Robb’d of my glory and my just rewardTo you O Grecians! be my wrong declared:So not a leader shall our conduct blameOr judge me envious of a rival’s fame.But shall not we ourselves the truth maintain?What needs appealing in a fact so plain?What Greek shall blame me if I bid thee riseAnd vindicate by oath th’ ill-gotten prize?Rise if thou darest before thy chariot standThe driving scourge high-lifted in thy hand;And touch thy steeds and swear thy whole intentWas but to conquer not to circumvent.Swear by that god whose liquid arms surroundThe globe and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground!”,ilias
The prudent chief with calm attention heard;Then mildly thus: “Excuse if youth have err’d;Superior as thou art forgive the offenceNor I thy equal or in years or sense.Thou know’st the errors of unripen’d ageWeak are its counsels headlong is its rage.The prize I quit if thou thy wrath resign;The mare or aught thou ask’st be freely thineEre I become (from thy dear friendship torn)Hateful to thee and to the gods forsworn.”,ilias
So spoke Antilochus; and at the wordThe mare contested to the king restored.Joy swells his soul: as when the vernal grainLifts the green ear above the springing plainThe fields their vegetable life renewAnd laugh and glitter with the morning dew;Such joy the Spartan’s shining face o’erspreadAnd lifted his gay heart while thus he said:,ilias
“Still may our souls O generous youth! agree’Tis now Atrides’ turn to yield to thee.Rash heat perhaps a moment might controlNot break the settled temper of thy soul.Not but (my friend) ’tis still the wiser wayTo waive contention with superior sway;For ah! how few who should like thee offendLike thee have talents to regain the friend!To plead indulgence and thy fault atoneSuffice thy father’s merit and thy own:Generous alike for me the sire and sonHave greatly suffer’d and have greatly done.I yield; that all may know my soul can bendNor is my pride preferr’d before my friend.”,ilias
He said; and pleased his passion to commandResign’d the courser to Noemon’s handFriend of the youthful chief: himself contentThe shining charger to his vessel sent.The golden talents Merion next obtain’d;The fifth reward the double bowl remain’d.Achilles this to reverend Nestor bears.And thus the purpose of his gift declares:“Accept thou this O sacred sire! (he said)In dear memorial of Patroclus dead;Dead and for ever lost Patroclus liesFor ever snatch’d from our desiring eyes!Take thou this token of a grateful heartThough ’tis not thine to hurl the distant dartThe quoit to toss the ponderous mace to wieldOr urge the race or wrestle on the field:Thy pristine vigour age has overthrownBut left the glory of the past thy own.”,ilias
The prizes next are order’d to the fieldFor the bold champions who the caestus wield.A stately mule as yet by toils unbrokeOf six years’ age unconscious of the yokeIs to the circus led and firmly bound;Next stands a goblet massy large and round.Achilles rising thus: “Let Greece exciteTwo heroes equal to this hardy fight;Who dare the foe with lifted arms provokeAnd rush beneath the long-descending stroke.On whom Apollo shall the palm bestowAnd whom the Greeks supreme by conquest knowThis mule his dauntless labours shall repayThe vanquish’d bear the massy bowl away.”,ilias
This dreadful combat great Epeus chose;291High o’er the crowd enormous bulk! he roseAnd seized the beast and thus began to say:“Stand forth some man to bear the bowl away!(Price of his ruin: for who dares denyThis mule my right; the undoubted victor I)Others ’tis own’d in fields of battle shineBut the first honours of this fight are mine;For who excels in all? Then let my foeDraw near but first his certain fortune know;Secure this hand shall his whole frame confoundMash all his bones and all his body pound:So let his friends be nigh a needful trainTo heave the batter’d carcase off the plain.”,ilias
He said; and straining heaved him off the groundWith matchless strength; that time Ulysses foundThe strength to evade and where the nerves combineHis ankle struck: the giant fell supine;Ulysses following on his bosom lies;Shouts of applause run rattling through the skies.Ajax to lift Ulysses next essays;He barely stirr’d him but he could not raise:His knee lock’d fast the foe’s attempt denied;And grappling close they tumbled side by side.Defiled with honourable dust they rollStill breathing strife and unsubdued of soul:Again they rage again to combat rise;When great Achilles thus divides the prize:,ilias
“Your noble vigour O my friends restrain;Nor weary out your generous strength in vain.Ye both have won: let others who excelNow prove that prowess you have proved so well.”,ilias
The hero’s words the willing chiefs obeyFrom their tired bodies wipe the dust awayAnd clothed anew the following games survey.,ilias
And now succeed the gifts ordain’d to graceThe youths contending in the rapid race:A silver urn that full six measures heldBy none in weight or workmanship excell’d:Sidonian artists taught the frame to shineElaborate with artifice divine;Whence Tyrian sailors did the prize transportAnd gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port:From him descended good Eunaeus heir’dThe glorious gift; and for Lycaon sparedTo brave Patroclus gave the rich reward:Now the same hero’s funeral rites to graceIt stands the prize of swiftness in the race.A well-fed ox was for the second placed;And half a talent must content the last.Achilles rising then bespoke the train:“Who hope the palm of swiftness to obtainStand forth and bear these prizes from the plain.”,ilias
“Accursed fate! the conquest I forego;A mortal I a goddess was my foe;She urged her favourite on the rapid wayAnd Pallas not Ulysses won the day.”,ilias
Thus sourly wail’d he sputtering dirt and gore;A burst of laughter echoed through the shore.Antilochus more humorous than the restTakes the last prize and takes it with a jest:,ilias
“Why with our wiser elders should we strive?The gods still love them and they always thrive.Ye see to Ajax I must yield the prize:He to Ulysses still more aged and wise;(A green old age unconscious of decaysThat proves the hero born in better days!)Behold his vigour in this active race!Achilles only boasts a swifter pace:For who can match Achilles? He who canMust yet be more than hero more than man.”,ilias
The effect succeeds the speech. Pelides cries“Thy artful praise deserves a better prize.Nor Greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll’d;Receive a talent of the purest gold.”The youth departs content. The host admireThe son of Nestor worthy of his sire.,ilias
Next these a buckler spear and helm he brings;Cast on the plain the brazen burden rings:Arms which of late divine Sarpedon woreAnd great Patroclus in short triumph bore.“Stand forth the bravest of our host! (he cries)Whoever dares deserve so rich a prizeNow grace the lists before our army’s sightAnd sheathed in steel provoke his foe to fight.Who first the jointed armour shall exploreAnd stain his rival’s mail with issuing goreThe sword Asteropaeus possess’d of old(A Thracian blade distinct with studs of gold)Shall pay the stroke and grace the striker’s side:These arms in common let the chiefs divide:For each brave champion when the combat endsA sumptuous banquet at our tents attends.”,ilias
Fierce at the word uprose great Tydeus’ sonAnd the huge bulk of Ajax Telamon.Clad in refulgent steel on either handThe dreadful chiefs amid the circle stand;Louring they meet tremendous to the sight;Each Argive bosom beats with fierce delight.Opposed in arms not long they idly stoodBut thrice they closed and thrice the charge renew’d.A furious pass the spear of Ajax madeThrough the broad shield but at the corslet stay’d.Not thus the foe: his javelin aim’d aboveThe buckler’s margin at the neck he drove.But Greece now trembling for her hero’s lifeBade share the honours and surcease the strife.Yet still the victor’s due Tydides gainsWith him the sword and studded belt remains.,ilias
Then hurl’d the hero thundering on the groundA mass of iron (an enormous round)Whose weight and size the circling Greeks admireRude from the furnace and but shaped by fire.This mighty quoit Aetion wont to rearAnd from his whirling arm dismiss in air;The giant by Achilles slain he stow’dAmong his spoils this memorable load.For this he bids those nervous artists vieThat teach the disk to sound along the sky.“Let him whose might can hurl this bowl arise;Who farthest hurls it take it as his prize;If he be one enrich’d with large domainOf downs for flocks and arable for grainSmall stock of iron needs that man provide;His hinds and swains whole years shall be suppliedFrom hence; nor ask the neighbouring city’s aidFor ploughshares wheels and all the rural trade.”,ilias
Stern Polypoetes stepp’d before the throngAnd great Leonteus more than mortal strong;Whose force with rival forces to opposeUprose great Ajax; up Epeus rose.Each stood in order: first Epeus threw;High o’er the wondering crowds the whirling circle flew.Leonteus next a little space surpass’d;And third the strength of godlike Ajax cast.O’er both their marks it flew; till fiercely flungFrom Polypoetes’ arm the discus sung:Far as a swain his whirling sheephook throwsThat distant falls among the grazing cowsSo past them all the rapid circle flies:His friends while loud applauses shake the skiesWith force conjoin’d heave off the weighty prize.,ilias
Those who in skilful archery contendHe next invites the twanging bow to bend;And twice ten axes casts amidst the roundTen double-edged and ten that singly woundThe mast which late a first-rate galley boreThe hero fixes in the sandy shore;To the tall top a milk-white dove they tieThe trembling mark at which their arrows fly.,ilias
To close the funeral games Achilles lastA massy spear amid the circle placedAnd ample charger of unsullied frameWith flowers high-wrought not blacken’d yet by flame.For these he bids the heroes prove their artWhose dexterous skill directs the flying dart.Here too great Merion hopes the noble prize;Nor here disdain’d the king of men to rise.With joy Pelides saw the honour paidRose to the monarch and respectful said:,ilias
“Thee first in virtue as in power supremeO king of nations! all thy Greeks proclaim;In every martial game thy worth attestAnd know thee both their greatest and their best.Take then the prize but let brave Merion bearThis beamy javelin in thy brother’s war.”,ilias
Pleased from the hero’s lips his praise to hearThe king to Merion gives the brazen spear:But set apart for sacred use commandsThe glittering charger to Talthybius’ hands.,ilias
The gods deliberate about the redemption of Hector’s body. Jupitersends Thetis to Achilles to dispose him for the restoring it and Iristo Priam to encourage him to go in person and treat for it. The oldking notwithstanding the remonstrances of his queen makes ready forthe journey to which he is encouraged by an omen from Jupiter. He setsforth in his chariot with a waggon loaded with presents under thecharge of Idaeus the herald. Mercury descends in the shape of a youngman and conducts him to the pavilion of Achilles. Their conversationon the way. Priam finds Achilles at his table casts himself at hisfeet and begs for the body of his son: Achilles moved withcompassion grants his request detains him one night in his tent andthe next morning sends him home with the body: the Trojans run out tomeet him. The lamentations of Andromache Hecuba and Helen with thesolemnities of the funeral.,ilias
The time of twelve days is employed in this book while the body ofHector lies in the tent of Achilles; and as many more are spent in thetruce allowed for his interment. The scene is partly in Achilles’ campand partly in Troy.,ilias
“If equal honours by the partial skiesAre doom’d both heroes (Juno thus replies)If Thetis’ son must no distinction knowThen hear ye gods! the patron of the bow.But Hector only boasts a mortal claimHis birth deriving from a mortal dame:Achilles of your own ethereal raceSprings from a goddess by a man’s embrace(A goddess by ourself to Peleus givenA man divine and chosen friend of heaven)To grace those nuptials from the bright abodeYourselves were present; where this minstrel-godWell pleased to share the feast amid the quireStood proud to hymn and tune his youthful lyre.”,ilias
Then thus the Thunderer checks the imperial dame:“Let not thy wrath the court of heaven inflame;Their merits nor their honours are the same.But mine and every god’s peculiar graceHector deserves of all the Trojan race:Still on our shrines his grateful offerings lay(The only honours men to gods can pay)Nor ever from our smoking altar ceasedThe pure libation and the holy feast:Howe’er by stealth to snatch the corse awayWe will not: Thetis guards it night and day.But haste and summon to our courts aboveThe azure queen; let her persuasion moveHer furious son from Priam to receiveThe proffer’d ransom and the corse to leave.”,ilias
Then through the world of waters they repair(The way fair Iris led) to upper air.The deeps dividing o’er the coast they riseAnd touch with momentary flight the skies.There in the lightning’s blaze the sire they foundAnd all the gods in shining synod round.Thetis approach’d with anguish in her face(Minerva rising gave the mourner place)Even Juno sought her sorrows to consoleAnd offer’d from her hand the nectar-bowl:She tasted and resign’d it: then beganThe sacred sire of gods and mortal man:,ilias
“Thou comest fair Thetis but with grief o’ercast;Maternal sorrows; long ah long to last!Suffice we know and we partake thy cares;But yield to fate and hear what Jove declares.Nine days are past since all the court aboveIn Hector’s cause have moved the ear of Jove;’Twas voted Hermes from his godlike foeBy stealth should bear him but we will’d not so:We will thy son himself the corse restoreAnd to his conquest add this glory more.Then hie thee to him and our mandate bear:Tell him he tempts the wrath of heaven too far;Nor let him more (our anger if he dread)Vent his mad vengeance on the sacred dead;But yield to ransom and the father’s prayer;The mournful father Iris shall prepareWith gifts to sue; and offer to his handsWhate’er his honour asks or heart demands.”,ilias
His word the silver-footed queen attendsAnd from Olympus’ snowy tops descends.Arrived she heard the voice of loud lamentAnd echoing groans that shook the lofty tent:His friends prepare the victim and disposeRepast unheeded while he vents his woes;The goddess seats her by her pensive sonShe press’d his hand and tender thus begun:,ilias
“How long unhappy! shall thy sorrows flowAnd thy heart waste with life-consuming woe:Mindless of food or love whose pleasing reignSoothes weary life and softens human pain?O snatch the moments yet within thy power;Not long to live indulge the amorous hour!Lo! Jove himself (for Jove’s command I bear)Forbids to tempt the wrath of heaven too far.No longer then (his fury if thou dread)Detain the relics of great Hector dead;Nor vent on senseless earth thy vengeance vainBut yield to ransom and restore the slain.”,ilias
While thus they communed from the Olympian bowersJove orders Iris to the Trojan towers:“Haste winged goddess! to the sacred townAnd urge her monarch to redeem his son.Alone the Ilian ramparts let him leaveAnd bear what stern Achilles may receive:Alone for so we will; no Trojan nearExcept to place the dead with decent careSome aged herald who with gentle handMay the slow mules and funeral car command.Nor let him death nor let him danger dreadSafe through the foe by our protection led:Him Hermes to Achilles shall conveyGuard of his life and partner of his way.Fierce as he is Achilles’ self shall spareHis age nor touch one venerable hair:Some thought there must be in a soul so braveSome sense of duty some desire to save.”,ilias
Then down her bow the winged Iris drivesAnd swift at Priam’s mournful court arrives:Where the sad sons beside their father’s throneSat bathed in tears and answer’d groan with groan.And all amidst them lay the hoary sire(Sad scene of woe!) his face his wrapp’d attireConceal’d from sight; with frantic hands he spreadA shower of ashes o’er his neck and head.From room to room his pensive daughters roam;Whose shrieks and clamours fill the vaulted dome;Mindful of those who late their pride and joyLie pale and breathless round the fields of Troy!Before the king Jove’s messenger appearsAnd thus in whispers greets his trembling ears:,ilias
“Fear not O father! no ill news I bear;From Jove I come Jove makes thee still his care;For Hector’s sake these walls he bids thee leaveAnd bear what stern Achilles may receive;Alone for so he wills; no Trojan nearExcept to place the dead with decent careSome aged herald who with gentle handMay the slow mules and funeral car command.Nor shalt thou death nor shalt thou danger dread:Safe through the foe by his protection led:Thee Hermes to Pelides shall conveyGuard of thy life and partner of thy way.Fierce as he is Achilles’ self shall spareThy age nor touch one venerable hair;Some thought there must be in a soul so braveSome sense of duty some desire to save.”,ilias
She spoke and vanish’d. Priam bids prepareHis gentle mules and harness to the car;There for the gifts a polish’d casket lay:His pious sons the king’s command obey.Then pass’d the monarch to his bridal-roomWhere cedar-beams the lofty roofs perfumeAnd where the treasures of his empire lay;Then call’d his queen and thus began to say:,ilias
“Unhappy consort of a king distress’d!Partake the troubles of thy husband’s breast:I saw descend the messenger of JoveWho bids me try Achilles’ mind to move;Forsake these ramparts and with gifts obtainThe corse of Hector at yon navy slain.Tell me thy thought: my heart impels to goThrough hostile camps and bears me to the foe.”,ilias
“Seek not to stay me nor my soul affrightWith words of omen like a bird of night(Replied unmoved the venerable man;)’Tis heaven commands me and you urge in vain.Had any mortal voice the injunction laidNor augur priest nor seer had been obey’d.A present goddess brought the high commandI saw I heard her and the word shall stand.I go ye gods! obedient to your call:If in yon camp your powers have doom’d my fallContent—By the same hand let me expire!Add to the slaughter’d son the wretched sire!One cold embrace at least may be allow’dAnd my last tears flow mingled with his blood!”,ilias
From forth his open’d stores this said he drewTwelve costly carpets of refulgent hueAs many vests as many mantles toldAnd twelve fair veils and garments stiff with goldTwo tripods next and twice two chargers shineWith ten pure talents from the richest mine;And last a large well-labour’d bowl had place(The pledge of treaties once with friendly Thrace:)Seem’d all too mean the stores he could employFor one last look to buy him back to Troy!,ilias
Lo! the sad father frantic with his painAround him furious drives his menial train:In vain each slave with duteous care attendsEach office hurts him and each face offends.“What make ye here officious crowds! (he cries):Hence! nor obtrude your anguish on my eyes.Have ye no griefs at home to fix ye there:Am I the only object of despair?Am I become my people’s common showSet up by Jove your spectacle of woe?No you must feel him too; yourselves must fall;The same stern god to ruin gives you all:Nor is great Hector lost by me alone;Your sole defence your guardian power is gone!I see your blood the fields of Phrygia drownI see the ruins of your smoking town!O send me gods! ere that sad day shall comeA willing ghost to Pluto’s dreary dome!”,ilias
He said and feebly drives his friends away:The sorrowing friends his frantic rage obey.Next on his sons his erring fury fallsPolites Paris Agathon he calls;His threats Deiphobus and Dius hearHippothous Pammon Helenes the seerAnd generous Antiphon: for yet these nineSurvived sad relics of his numerous line.,ilias
“Inglorious sons of an unhappy sire!Why did not all in Hector’s cause expire?Wretch that I am! my bravest offspring slain.You the disgrace of Priam’s house remain!Mestor the brave renown’d in ranks of warWith Troilus dreadful on his rushing car293And last great Hector more than man divineFor sure he seem’d not of terrestrial line!All those relentless Mars untimely slewAnd left me these a soft and servile crewWhose days the feast and wanton dance employGluttons and flatterers the contempt of Troy!Why teach ye not my rapid wheels to runAnd speed my journey to redeem my son?”,ilias
“Take this and pour to Jove; that safe from harmsHis grace restore thee to our roof and arms.Since victor of thy fears and slighting mineHeaven or thy soul inspires this bold design;Pray to that god who high on Ida’s browSurveys thy desolated realms belowHis winged messenger to send from highAnd lead thy way with heavenly augury:Let the strong sovereign of the plumy raceTower on the right of yon ethereal space.That sign beheld and strengthen’d from aboveBoldly pursue the journey mark’d by Jove:But if the god his augury deniesSuppress thy impulse nor reject advice.”,ilias
“’Tis just (said Priam) to the sire aboveTo raise our hands; for who so good as Jove?”He spoke and bade the attendant handmaid bringThe purest water of the living spring:(Her ready hands the ewer and bason held:)Then took the golden cup his queen had fill’d;On the mid pavement pours the rosy wineUplifts his eyes and calls the power divine:,ilias
“O first and greatest! heaven’s imperial lord!On lofty Ida’s holy hill adored!To stern Achilles now direct my waysAnd teach him mercy when a father prays.If such thy will despatch from yonder skyThy sacred bird celestial augury!Let the strong sovereign of the plumy raceTower on the right of yon ethereal space;So shall thy suppliant strengthen’d from aboveFearless pursue the journey mark’d by Jove.”,ilias
The afflicted monarch shiver’d with despair;Pale grew his face and upright stood his hair;Sunk was his heart; his colour went and came;A sudden trembling shook his aged frame:When Hermes greeting touch’d his royal handAnd gentle thus accosts with kind demand:,ilias
“Say whither father! when each mortal sightIs seal’d in sleep thou wanderest through the night?Why roam thy mules and steeds the plains alongThrough Grecian foes so numerous and so strong?What couldst thou hope should these thy treasures view;These who with endless hate thy race pursue?For what defence alas! could’st thou provide;Thyself not young a weak old man thy guide?Yet suffer not thy soul to sink with dread;From me no harm shall touch thy reverend head;From Greece I’ll guard thee too; for in those linesThe living image of my father shines.”,ilias
“Thy words that speak benevolence of mindAre true my son! (the godlike sire rejoin’d:)Great are my hazards; but the gods surveyMy steps and send thee guardian of my way.Hail and be bless’d! For scarce of mortal kindAppear thy form thy feature and thy mind.”,ilias
“Nor true are all thy words nor erring wide;(The sacred messenger of heaven replied;)But say convey’st thou through the lonely plainsWhat yet most precious of thy store remainsTo lodge in safety with some friendly hand:Prepared perchance to leave thy native land?Or fliest thou now?—What hopes can Troy retainThy matchless son her guard and glory slain?”,ilias
The king alarm’d: “Say what and whence thou artWho search the sorrows of a parent’s heartAnd know so well how godlike Hector died?”Thus Priam spoke and Hermes thus replied:,ilias
“You tempt me father and with pity touch:On this sad subject you inquire too much.Oft have these eyes that godlike Hector view’dIn glorious fight with Grecian blood embrued:I saw him when like Jove his flames he toss’dOn thousand ships and wither’d half a host:I saw but help’d not: stern Achilles’ ireForbade assistance and enjoy’d the fire.For him I serve of Myrmidonian race;One ship convey’d us from our native place;Polyctor is my sire an honour’d nameOld like thyself and not unknown to fame;Of seven his sons by whom the lot was castTo serve our prince it fell on me the last.To watch this quarter my adventure falls:For with the morn the Greeks attack your walls;Sleepless they sit impatient to engageAnd scarce their rulers check their martial rage.”,ilias
“If then thou art of stern Pelides’ train(The mournful monarch thus rejoin’d again)Ah tell me truly where oh! where are laidMy son’s dear relics? what befalls him dead?Have dogs dismember’d (on the naked plains)Or yet unmangled rest his cold remains?”,ilias
“O favour’d of the skies! (thus answered thenThe power that mediates between god and men)Nor dogs nor vultures have thy Hector rentBut whole he lies neglected in the tent:This the twelfth evening since he rested thereUntouch’d by worms untainted by the air.Still as Aurora’s ruddy beam is spreadRound his friend’s tomb Achilles drags the dead:Yet undisfigured or in limb or faceAll fresh he lies with every living graceMajestical in death! No stains are foundO’er all the corse and closed is every woundThough many a wound they gave. Some heavenly careSome hand divine preserves him ever fair:Or all the host of heaven to whom he ledA life so grateful still regard him dead.”,ilias
Thus spoke to Priam the celestial guideAnd joyful thus the royal sire replied:“Blest is the man who pays the gods aboveThe constant tribute of respect and love!Those who inhabit the Olympian bowerMy son forgot not in exalted power;And heaven that every virtue bears in mindEven to the ashes of the just is kind.But thou O generous youth! this goblet takeA pledge of gratitude for Hector’s sake;And while the favouring gods our steps surveySafe to Pelides’ tent conduct my way.”,ilias
To whom the latent god: “O king forbearTo tempt my youth for apt is youth to err.But can I absent from my prince’s sightTake gifts in secret that must shun the light?What from our master’s interest thus we drawIs but a licensed theft that ’scapes the law.Respecting him my soul abjures the offence;And as the crime I dread the consequence.Thee far as Argos pleased I could convey;Guard of thy life and partner of thy way:On thee attend thy safety to maintainO’er pathless forests or the roaring main.”,ilias
Thus having said he vanish’d from his eyesAnd in a moment shot into the skies:The king confirm’d from heaven alighted thereAnd left his aged herald on the carWith solemn pace through various rooms he wentAnd found Achilles in his inner tent:There sat the hero: Alcimus the braveAnd great Automedon attendance gave:These served his person at the royal feast;Around at awful distance stood the rest.,ilias
Unseen by these the king his entry made:And prostrate now before Achilles laidSudden (a venerable sight!) appears;Embraced his knees and bathed his hands in tears;Those direful hands his kisses press’d embruedEven with the best the dearest of his blood!,ilias
As when a wretch (who conscious of his crimePursued for murder flies his native clime)Just gains some frontier breathless pale amazedAll gaze all wonder: thus Achilles gazed:Thus stood the attendants stupid with surprise:All mute yet seem’d to question with their eyes:Each look’d on other none the silence brokeTill thus at last the kingly suppliant spoke:,ilias
“For him through hostile camps I bent my wayFor him thus prostrate at thy feet I lay;Large gifts proportion’d to thy wrath I bear;O hear the wretched and the gods revere!,ilias
“Think of thy father and this face behold!See him in me as helpless and as old!Though not so wretched: there he yields to meThe first of men in sovereign misery!Thus forced to kneel thus grovelling to embraceThe scourge and ruin of my realm and race;Suppliant my children’s murderer to imploreAnd kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore!”,ilias
These words soft pity in the chief inspireTouch’d with the dear remembrance of his sire.Then with his hand (as prostrate still he lay)The old man’s cheek he gently turn’d away.Now each by turns indulged the gush of woe;And now the mingled tides together flow:This low on earth that gently bending o’er;A father one and one a son deplore:But great Achilles different passions rendAnd now his sire he mourns and now his friend.The infectious softness through the heroes ran;One universal solemn shower began;They bore as heroes but they felt as man.,ilias
Satiate at length with unavailing woesFrom the high throne divine Achilles rose;The reverend monarch by the hand he raised;On his white beard and form majestic gazedNot unrelenting; then serene beganWith words to soothe the miserable man:,ilias
To whom the king: “O favour’d of the skies!Here let me grow to earth! since Hector liesOn the bare beach deprived of obsequies.O give me Hector! to my eyes restoreHis corse and take the gifts: I ask no more.Thou as thou may’st these boundless stores enjoy;Safe may’st thou sail and turn thy wrath from Troy;So shall thy pity and forbearance giveA weak old man to see the light and live!”,ilias
“Move me no more (Achilles thus repliesWhile kindling anger sparkled in his eyes)Nor seek by tears my steady soul to bend:To yield thy Hector I myself intend:For know from Jove my goddess-mother came(Old Ocean’s daughter silver-footed dame)Nor comest thou but by heaven; nor comest aloneSome god impels with courage not thy own:No human hand the weighty gates unbarr’dNor could the boldest of our youth have daredTo pass our outworks or elude the guard.Cease; lest neglectful of high Jove’s commandI show thee king! thou tread’st on hostile land;Release my knees thy suppliant arts give o’erAnd shake the purpose of my soul no more.”,ilias
The sire obey’d him trembling and o’eraw’d.Achilles like a lion rush’d abroad:Automedon and Alcimus attend(Whom most he honour’d since he lost his friend)These to unyoke the mules and horses wentAnd led the hoary herald to the tent;Next heap’d on high the numerous presents bear(Great Hector’s ransom) from the polish’d car.Two splendid mantles and a carpet spreadThey leave: to cover and enwrap the dead.Then call the handmaids with assistant toilTo wash the body and anoint with oilApart from Priam: lest the unhappy sireProvoked to passion once more rouse to ireThe stern Pelides; and nor sacred ageNor Jove’s command should check the rising rage.This done the garments o’er the corse they spread;Achilles lifts it to the funeral bed:Then while the body on the car they laidHe groans and calls on loved Patroclus’ shade:,ilias
“If in that gloom which never light must knowThe deeds of mortals touch the ghosts belowO friend! forgive me that I thus fulfil(Restoring Hector) heaven’s unquestion’d will.The gifts the father gave be ever thineTo grace thy manes and adorn thy shrine.”296,ilias
“Such griefs O king! have other parents known;Remember theirs and mitigate thy own.The care of heaven thy Hector has appear’dNor shall he lie unwept and uninterr’d;Soon may thy aged cheeks in tears be drown’dAnd all the eyes of Ilion stream around.”,ilias
He said and rising chose the victim eweWith silver fleece which his attendants slew.The limbs they sever from the reeking hideWith skill prepare them and in parts divide:Each on the coals the separate morsels laysAnd hasty snatches from the rising blaze.With bread the glittering canisters they loadWhich round the board Automedon bestow’d.The chief himself to each his portion placedAnd each indulging shared in sweet repast.When now the rage of hunger was repress’dThe wondering hero eyes his royal guest:No less the royal guest the hero eyesHis godlike aspect and majestic size;Here youthful grace and noble fire engage;And there the mild benevolence of age.Thus gazing long the silence neither broke(A solemn scene!) at length the father spoke:,ilias
“Permit me now beloved of Jove! to steepMy careful temples in the dew of sleep:For since the day that number’d with the deadMy hapless son the dust has been my bed;Soft sleep a stranger to my weeping eyes;My only food my sorrows and my sighs!Till now encouraged by the grace you giveI share thy banquet and consent to live.”,ilias
With that Achilles bade prepare the bedWith purple soft and shaggy carpets spread;Forth by the flaming lights they bend their wayAnd place the couches and the coverings lay.Then he: “Now father sleep but sleep not here;Consult thy safety and forgive my fearLest any Argive at this hour awakeTo ask our counsel or our orders takeApproaching sudden to our open’d tentPerchance behold thee and our grace prevent.Should such report thy honour’d person hereThe king of men the ransom might defer;But say with speed if aught of thy desireRemains unask’d; what time the rites requireTo inter thy Hector? For so long we stayOur slaughtering arm and bid the hosts obey.”,ilias
“If then thy will permit (the monarch said)To finish all due honours to the deadThis of thy grace accord: to thee are knownThe fears of Ilion closed within her town;And at what distance from our walls aspireThe hills of Ide and forests for the fire.Nine days to vent our sorrows I requestThe tenth shall see the funeral and the feast;The next to raise his monument be given;The twelfth we war if war be doom’d by heaven!”,ilias
Then gave his hand at parting to preventThe old man’s fears and turn’d within the tent;Where fair Briseis bright in blooming charmsExpects her hero with desiring arms.But in the porch the king and herald rest;Sad dreams of care yet wandering in their breast.Now gods and men the gifts of sleep partake;Industrious Hermes only was awakeThe king’s return revolving in his mindTo pass the ramparts and the watch to blind.The power descending hover’d o’er his head:“And sleep’st thou father! (thus the vision said:)Now dost thou sleep when Hector is restored?Nor fear the Grecian foes or Grecian lord?Thy presence here should stern Atrides seeThy still surviving sons may sue for thee;May offer all thy treasures yet containTo spare thy age; and offer all in vain.”,ilias
Waked with the word the trembling sire aroseAnd raised his friend: the god before him goes:He joins the mules directs them with his handAnd moves in silence through the hostile land.When now to Xanthus’ yellow stream they drove(Xanthus immortal progeny of Jove)The winged deity forsook their viewAnd in a moment to Olympus flew.Now shed Aurora round her saffron raySprang through the gates of light and gave the day:Charged with the mournful load to Ilion goThe sage and king majestically slow.Cassandra first beholds from Ilion’s spireThe sad procession of her hoary sire;Then as the pensive pomp advanced more near(Her breathless brother stretched upon the bier)A shower of tears o’erflows her beauteous eyesAlarming thus all Ilion with her cries:,ilias
“Turn here your steps and here your eyes employYe wretched daughters and ye sons of Troy!If e’er ye rush’d in crowds with vast delightTo hail your hero glorious from the fightNow meet him dead and let your sorrows flow;Your common triumph and your common woe.”,ilias
In thronging crowds they issue to the plains;Nor man nor woman in the walls remains;In every face the self-same grief is shown;And Troy sends forth one universal groan.At Scaea’s gates they meet the mourning wainHang on the wheels and grovel round the slain.The wife and mother frantic with despairKiss his pale cheek and rend their scatter’d hair:Thus wildly wailing at the gates they lay;And there had sigh’d and sorrow’d out the day;But godlike Priam from the chariot rose:“Forbear (he cried) this violence of woes;First to the palace let the car proceedThen pour your boundless sorrows o’er the dead.”,ilias
The waves of people at his word divideSlow rolls the chariot through the following tide;Even to the palace the sad pomp they wait:They weep and place him on the bed of state.A melancholy choir attend aroundWith plaintive sighs and music’s solemn sound:Alternately they sing alternate flowThe obedient tears melodious in their woe.While deeper sorrows groan from each full heartAnd nature speaks at every pause of art.,ilias
The mournful mother next sustains her part:“O thou the best the dearest to my heart!Of all my race thou most by heaven approvedAnd by the immortals even in death beloved!While all my other sons in barbarous bandsAchilles bound and sold to foreign landsThis felt no chains but went a glorious ghostFree and a hero to the Stygian coast.Sentenced ’tis true by his inhuman doomThy noble corse was dragg’d around the tomb;(The tomb of him thy warlike arm had slain;)Ungenerous insult impotent and vain!Yet glow’st thou fresh with every living grace;No mark of pain or violence of face:Rosy and fair! as Phoebus’ silver bowDismiss’d thee gently to the shades below.”,ilias
Thus spoke the dame and melted into tears.Sad Helen next in pomp of grief appears;Fast from the shining sluices of her eyesFall the round crystal drops while thus she cries.,ilias
“Ah dearest friend! in whom the gods had join’d298The mildest manners with the bravest mindNow twice ten years (unhappy years) are o’erSince Paris brought me to the Trojan shore(O had I perish’d ere that form divineSeduced this soft this easy heart of mine!)Yet was it ne’er my fate from thee to findA deed ungentle or a word unkind.When others cursed the authoress of their woeThy pity check’d my sorrows in their flow.If some proud brother eyed me with disdainOr scornful sister with her sweeping trainThy gentle accents soften’d all my pain.For thee I mourn and mourn myself in theeThe wretched source of all this misery.The fate I caused for ever I bemoan;Sad Helen has no friend now thou art gone!Through Troy’s wide streets abandon’d shall I roam!In Troy deserted as abhorr’d at home!”,ilias
So spoke the fair with sorrow-streaming eye.Distressful beauty melts each stander-by.On all around the infectious sorrow grows;But Priam check’d the torrent as it rose:“Perform ye Trojans! what the rites requireAnd fell the forests for a funeral pyre;Twelve days nor foes nor secret ambush dread;Achilles grants these honours to the dead.”299,ilias
We have now passed through the Iliad and seen the anger of Achillesand the terrible effects of it at an end: as that only was the subjectof the poem and the nature of epic poetry would not permit our authorto proceed to the event of the war it perhaps may be acceptable to thecommon reader to give a short account of what happened to Troy and thechief actors in this poem after the conclusion of it.,ilias

“The voice” observes Heeren “was always accompanied by someinstrument. The bard was provided with a harp on which he played aprelude to elevate and inspire his mind and with which he accompaniedthe song when begun. His voice probably preserved a medium betweensinging and recitation; the words and not the melody were regarded bythe listeners hence it was necessary for him to remain intelligible toall.

4. “Should it not be since _my_ arrival? asks Mackenzie observingthat “poplars can hardly live so long”. But setting aside the fact thatwe must not expect consistency in a mere romance the ancients had asuperstitious belief in the great age of trees which grew near placesconsecrated by the presence of gods and great men. See Cicero de LeggII I sub init. where he speaks of the plane tree under which Socratesused to walk and of the tree at Delos where Latona gave birth toApollo.

66. It has been observed that the annual procession of the sacred shipso often represented on Egyptian monuments and the return of the deityfrom Ethiopia after some days’ absence serves to show the Ethiopianorigin of Thebes and of the worship of Jupiter Ammon. “I think” saysHeeren after quoting a passage from Diodorus about the holy ship“that this procession is represented in one of the great sculpturedreliefs on the temple of Karnak. The sacred ship of Ammon is on theshore with its whole equipment and is towed along by another boat. Itis therefore on its voyage. This must have been one of the mostcelebrated festivals since even according to the interpretation ofantiquity Homer alludes to it when he speaks of Jupiter’s visit to theEthiopians and his twelve days’ absence.”—Long “Egyptian Antiquities”vol. 1 p. 96. Eustathius vol. 1 p. 98 sq. (ed. Basil) gives thisinterpretation and likewise an allegorical one which we will sparethe reader.,ilias

74. The occasion on which Vulcan incurred Jove’s displeasure wasthis—After Hercules had taken and pillaged Troy Juno raised a stormwhich drove him to the island of Cos having previously cast Jove intoa sleep to prevent him aiding his son. Jove in revenge fastened ironanvils to her feet and hung her from the sky and Vulcan attemptingto relieve her was kicked down from Olympus in the manner described.The allegorists have gone mad in finding deep explanations for thisamusing fiction.

75. It is ingeniously observed by Grote vol i p. 463 that “The godsformed a sort of political community of their own which had itshierarchy its distribution of ranks and duties its contentions forpower and occasional revolutions its public meetings in the agora ofOlympus and its multitudinous banquets or festivals.”,ilias
76. Plato Rep. iii. p. 437 was so scandalized at this deception ofJupiter’s and at his other attacks on the character of the gods thathe would fain sentence him to an honourable banishment.

The fate whichawaits a presumptuous critic even where his virulent reproaches aresubstantially well-founded is plainly set forth in the treatment ofThersites; while the unpopularity of such a character is attested evenmore by the excessive pains which Homer takes to heap upon himrepulsive personal deformities than by the chastisement of Odysseus heis lame bald crook-backed of misshapen head and squintingvision.”—Grote vol. i. p. 97.,ilias
89. According to Pausanias both the sprig and the remains of the treewere exhibited in his time.

To Jupiter Ceres Juno Apollo and Bacchus victims ofadvanced age might be offered. An ox of five years old was consideredespecially acceptable to Jupiter. A black bull a ram or a boar pigwere offerings for Neptune. A heifer or a sheep for Minerva. To Ceresa sow was sacrificed as an enemy to corn. The goat to Bacchus becausehe fed on vines. Diana was propitiated with a stag; and to Venus thedove was consecrated. The infernal and evil deities were to be appeasedwith black victims.

“Galen appears uncertain whether Asklepius (as well as Dionysus) wasoriginally a god or whether he was first a man and then becameafterwards a god; but Apollodorus professed to fix the exact date ofhis apotheosis.

158. “No trumpets or any other instruments of sound are used in theHomeric action itself; but the trumpet was known and is introduced forthe purpose of illustration as employed in war.

Coined money is unknownin the Homeric age—the trade carried on being one of barter. Inreference also to the metals it deserves to be remarked that theHomeric descriptions universally suppose copper and not iron to beemployed for arms both offensive and defensive.

167. The manner in which this episode is introduced is wellillustrated by the following remarks of Mure vol. i. p.298: “Thepoet’s method of introducing his episode also illustrates in acurious manner his tact in the dramatic department of his art. Wherefor example one or more heroes are despatched on some commission tobe executed at a certain distance of time or place the fulfilment ofthis task is not as a general rule immediately described. A certaininterval is allowed them for reaching the appointed scene of actionwhich interval is dramatised as it were either by a temporarycontinuation of the previous narrative or by fixing attention for awhile on some new transaction at the close of which the furtheraccount of the mission is resumed.”,ilias

This however was also one of the ordinary formal modes ofpunishment for great public offences. It may have been originallyconnected with the same feeling—the desire of avoiding the pollution ofbloodshed—which seems to have suggested the practice of buryingprisoners alive with a scantling of food by their side. Though Homermakes no mention of this horrible usage the example of the RomanVestals affords reasons for believing that in ascribing it to theheroic ages Sophocles followed an authentic tradition.”—Thirlwall’sGreece vol. i. p. 171 sq.,ilias
175. —_Paris’ lofty dome._ “With respect to the private dwellingswhich are oftenest described the poet’s language barely enables us toform a general notion of their ordinary plan and affords no conceptionof the style which prevailed in them or of their effect on the eye. Itseems indeed probable from the manner in which he dwells on theirmetallic ornaments that the higher beauty of proportion was but littlerequired or understood and it is perhaps strength and conveniencerather than elegance that he means to commend in speaking of the fairhouse which Paris had built for himself with the aid of the mostskilful masons of Troy.”—Thirlwall’s Greece vol. i. p. 231.,ilias

186. —_Embattled walls._ “Another essential basis of mechanical unityin the poem is the construction of the rampart. This takes place in theseventh book. The reason ascribed for the glaring improbability thatthe Greeks should have left their camp and fleet unfortified duringnine years in the midst of a hostile country is a purely poeticalone: ‘So long as Achilles fought the terror of his name sufficed tokeep every foe at a distance.’ The disasters consequent on hissecession first led to the necessity of other means of protection.Accordingly in the battles previous to the eighth book no allusionoccurs to a rampart; in all those which follow it forms a prominentfeature. Here then in the anomaly as in the propriety of the Iliadthe destiny of Achilles or rather this peculiar crisis of it formsthe pervading bond of connexion to the whole poem.”—Mure vol. i. p.257.,ilias

In the opening of the twentieth book this interdict iswithdrawn. During the twelve intermediate books it is kept steadily inview. No interposition takes place but on the part of the speciallyauthorised agents of Jove or on that of one or two contumaciousdeities described as boldly setting his commands at defiance butchecked and reprimanded for their disobedience; while the other divinewarriors who in the previous and subsequent cantos are so active insupport of their favourite heroes repeatedly allude to the supremeedict as the cause of their present inactivity.”—Mure vol. i. p 257.See however Muller “Greek Literature” ch. v. Section 6 and Grotevol. ii. p. 252.,ilias
“Some of the epithets which Homer applies to the heavens seem to implythat he considered it as a solid vault of metal. But it is notnecessary to construe these epithets so literally nor to draw any suchinference from his description of Atlas who holds the lofty pillarswhich keep earth and heaven asunder. Yet it would seem from the mannerin which the height of heaven is compared with the depth of Tartarusthat the region of light was thought to have certain bounds. The summitof the Thessalian Olympus was regarded as the highest point on theearth and it is not always carefully distinguished from the aerianregions above The idea of a seat of the gods—perhaps derived from amore ancient tradition in which it was not attached to anygeographical site—seems to be indistinctly blended in the poet’s mindwith that of the real mountain.”—Thirlwall’s Greece vol. i. p. 217sq.,ilias

201. In the heroic times it is not unfrequent for the king to receivepresents to purchase freedom from his wrath or immunity from hisexactions. Such gifts gradually became regular and formed the incomeof the German (Tacit. Germ. Section 15) Persian (Herodot. iii.89)and other kings. So too in the middle ages ‘The feudal aids are thebeginning of taxation of which they for a long time answered thepurpose.’ (Hallam Middle Ages ch. x. pt. 1 p. 189) This fact freesAchilles from the apparent charge of sordidness. Plato however (DeRep. vi. 4) says “We cannot commend Phoenix the tutor of Achillesas if he spoke correctly when counselling him to accept of presentsand assist the Greeks but without presents not to desist from hiswrath nor again should we commend Achilles himself or approve of hisbeing so covetous as to receive presents from Agamemnon” &c.,ilias
202. It may be observed that brief as is the mention of Briseis inthe Iliad and small the part she plays—what little is said ispre-eminently calculated to enhance her fitness to be the bride ofAchilles. Purity and retiring delicacy are features well contrastedwith the rough but tender disposition of the hero.,ilias
204. “Agamemnon when he offers to transfer to Achilles seven townsinhabited by wealthy husbandmen who would enrich their lord bypresents and tribute seems likewise to assume rather a property inthem than an authority over them. And the same thing may be intimatedwhen it is said that Peleus bestowed a great people the Dolopes ofPhthia on Phoenix.”—Thirlwall’s Greece vol. i Section 6 p. 162note.,ilias
205. —_Pray in deep silence._ Rather: “use well-omened words;” or asKennedy has explained it “Abstain from expressions unsuitable to thesolemnity of the occasion which by offending the god might defeatthe object of their supplications.”,ilias
206. —_Purest hands._ This is one of the most ancient superstitionsrespecting prayer and one founded as much in nature as in tradition.,ilias
207. It must be recollected that the war at Troy was not a settledsiege and that many of the chieftains busied themselves in piraticalexpeditions about its neighborhood. Such a one was that of whichAchilles now speaks. From the following verses it is evident thatfruits of these maraudings went to the common support of theexpedition and not to the successful plunderer.,ilias
209. —_Orchomenian town._ The topography of Orchomenus in Boeotia“situated” as it was “on the northern bank of the lake Æpais whichreceives not only the river Cephisus from the valleys of Phocis butalso other rivers from Parnassus and Helicon” (Grote vol. p. 181) wasa sufficient reason for its prosperity and decay. “As long as thechannels of these waters were diligently watched and kept clear alarge portion of the lake was in the condition of alluvial landpre-eminently rich and fertile. But when the channels came to be eitherneglected or designedly choked up by an enemy the water accumulatedin such a degree as to occupy the soil of more than one ancient isletand to occasion the change of the site of Orchomenus itself from theplain to the declivity of Mount Hyphanteion.” (Ibid.),ilias
210. The phrase “hundred gates” &c. seems to be merely expressive ofa great number. See notes to my prose translation p. 162.,ilias
“Many gifts he gave and o’erDolopia bade me rule; thee in his armsHe brought an infant on my bosom laidThe precious charge and anxiously enjoin’dThat I should rear thee as my own with allA parent’s love. I fail’d not in my trustAnd oft while round my neck thy hands were lock’dFrom thy sweet lips the half articulate soundOf Father came; and oft as children useMewling and puking didst thou drench my tunic.”,ilias
“This description” observes my learned friend (notes p. 121) “istaken from the passage of Homer II ix in translating which Popewith that squeamish artificial taste which distinguished the age ofAnne omits the natural (and let me add affecting) circumstance.”,ilias
“And the wineHeld to thy lips and many a time in fitsOf infant frowardness the purple juiceRejecting thou hast deluged all my vest,ilias
212. —_Where Calydon._ For a good sketch of the story of Meleager toolong to be inserted here see Grote vol. i. p. 195 sqq.; and for theauthorities see my notes to the prose translation p. 166.,ilias
213. “_Gifts can conquer_”—It is well observed by Bishop Thirlwall“Greece” vol. i. p 180 that the law of honour among the Greeks didnot compel them to treasure up in their memory the offensive languagewhich might be addressed to them by a passionate adversary nor toconceive that it left a stain which could only be washed away by blood.Even for real and deep injuries they were commonly willing to accept apecuniary compensation.”,ilias
217. —_Soft wool within i e._ a kind of woollen stuffing pressed inbetween the straps to protect the head and make the helmet fit close.,ilias
218. “All the circumstances of this action—the night Rhesus buried ina profound sleep and Diomede with the sword in his hand hanging overthe head of that prince—furnished Homer with the idea of this fictionwhich represents Rhesus lying fast asleep and as it were beholdinghis enemy in a dream plunging the sword into his bosom. This image isvery natural; for a man in his condition awakes no farther than to seeconfusedly what environs him and to think it not a reality but adream.”—Pope.,ilias
220. —_Red drops of blood._ “This phenomenon if a mere fruit of thepoet’s imagination might seem arbitrary or far-fetched. It is onehowever of ascertained reality and of no uncommon occurrence in theclimate of Greece.”—Mure i p. 493. Cf. Tasso Gier. Lib. ix. 15:,ilias
222. —_One of love._ Although a bastard brother received only a smallportion of the inheritance he was commonly very well treated. Priamappears to be the only one of whom polygamy is directly asserted in theIliad. Grote vol. ii. p. 114 note.,ilias
223.“Circled with foes as when a packe of bloodie jackals clingAbout a goodly palmed hart hurt with a hunter’s bowWhose escape his nimble feet insure whilst his warm blood doth flowAnd his light knees have power to move: but (maistred by his wound)Embost within a shady hill the jackals charge him roundAnd teare his flesh—when instantly fortune sends in the powersOf some sterne lion with whose sighte they flie and he devours.So they around Ulysses prest.”,ilias
225.“Where yon disorder’d heap of ruin liesStones rent from stones—where clouds of dust arise—Amid that smother Neptune holds his placeBelow the wall’s foundation drives his maceAnd heaves the building from the solid base.”,ilias
“Wherefore do I assumeThese royalties and not refuse to reignRefusing to accept as great a shareOf hazard as of honour due alike to himWho reigns and so much to him dueOf hazard more as he above the restHigh honour’d sits.”,ilias
229. —_Renown’d for justice and for length of days_ Arrian. de Exp.Alex. iv. p. 239 also speaks of the independence of these peoplewhich he regards as the result of their poverty and uprightness. Someauthors have regarded the phrase “Hippomolgian” _i.e._ “milking theirmares” as an epithet applicable to numerous tribes since the oldestof the Samatian nomads made their mares’ milk one of their chiefarticles of diet. The epithet abion or abion in this passage hasoccasioned much discussion. It may mean according as we read iteither “long-lived” or “bowless” the latter epithet indicating thatthey did not depend upon archery for subsistence.,ilias
“And as a round piece of a rocke which with a winter’s floodIs from his top torn when a shoure poured from a bursten cloudHath broke the naturall band it had within the roughftey rockFlies jumping all adourne the woods resounding everie shockeAnd on uncheckt it headlong leaps till in a plaine it stayAnd then (tho’ never so impelled) it stirs not any way:—So Hector—”,ilias
231. This book forms a most agreeable interruption to The continuousround of battles which occupy the latter part of the Iliad. It is aswell to observe that the sameness of these scenes renders many notesunnecessary.,ilias
Teneri sdegni e placide e tranquilleRepulse e cari vezzi e liete paciSorrisi parolette e dolci stilleDi pianto e sospir tronchi e molli baci.”,ilias
235.“Twice seven the charming daughters of the main—Around my person wait and bear my train:Succeed my wish and second my designThe fairest Deiopeia shall be thine.”,ilias
236. —_And Minos._ “By Homer Minos is described as the son of Jupiterand of the daughter of Phoenix whom all succeeding authors nameEuropa; and he is thus carried back into the remotest period of Cretanantiquity known to the poet apparently as a native hero Illustriousenough for a divine parentage and too ancient to allow his descent tobe traced to any other source. But in a genealogy recorded by laterwriters he is likewise the adopted son of Asterius as descendant ofDorus the son of Helen and is thus connected with a colony said tohave been led into Creta by Tentamus or Tectamus son of Dorus who isrelated either to have crossed over from Thessaly or to have embarkedat Malea after having led his followers by land intoLaconia.”—Thirlwall p. 136 seq.,ilias
“Forthwith on all sides to his aid was runBy angels many and strong who interpos’dDefence while others bore him on their shieldsBack to his chariot where it stood retir’dFrom off the files of war; there they him laidGnashing for anguish and despite and shame.”,ilias
240. —_For by the gods! who flies._ Observe the bold ellipsis of “hecries” and the transition from the direct to the oblique construction.So in Milton:—,ilias
“Thus at their shady lodge arriv’d both stoodBoth turn’d and under open sky ador’dThe God that made both sky air earth and heavenWhich they beheld the moon’s resplendent globeAnd starry pole.—Thou also mad’st the nightMaker omnipotent and thou the day.”,ilias
“But like a rock unmov’d a rock that bravesThe raging tempest and the rising waves—Propp’d on himself he stands: his solid sidesWash off the sea-weeds and the sounding tides.”,ilias
242. Protesilaus was the first Greek who fell slain by Hector as heleaped from the vessel to the Trojan shore. He was buried on theChersonese near the city of Plagusa. Hygin Fab. ciii. Tzetz. onLycophr. 245 528. There is a most elegant tribute to his memory in thePreface to the Heroica of Philostratus.,ilias
243. —_His best beloved._ The following elegant remarks of Thirlwall(Greece vol. i p. 176 seq.) well illustrate the character of thefriendship subsisting between these two heroes—,ilias
244.“As hungry wolves with raging appetiteScour through the fields ne’er fear the stormy night—Their whelps at home expect the promised foodAnd long to temper their dry chaps in blood—So rush’d we forth at once.”,ilias
246. —_Thrice at the battlements._ “The art military of the Homeric ageis upon a level with the state of navigation just described personalprowess decided every thing; the night attack and the ambuscadealthough much esteemed were never upon a large scale. The chiefs fightin advance and enact almost as much as the knights of romance. Thesiege of Troy was as little like a modern siege as a captain in theguards is like Achilles. There is no mention of a ditch or any otherline or work round the town and the wall itself was accessible withouta ladder. It was probably a vast mound of earth with a declivityoutwards. Patroclus thrice mounts it in armour. The Trojans are in norespects blockaded and receive assistance from their allies to thevery end.”—Coleridge p. 212.,ilias
“Fast by the manger stands the inactive steedAnd sunk in sorrow hangs his languid head;He stands and careless of his golden grainWeeps his associates and his master slain.”,ilias
“Nothing is heard upon the mountains nowBut pensive herds that for their master lowStraggling and comfortless about they roveUnmindful of their pasture and their love.”,ilias
“To close the pomp Æthon the steed of stateIs led the funeral of his lord to wait.Stripp’d of his trappings with a sullen paceHe walks and the big tears run rolling down his face.”,ilias
“Like to a bull that with impetuous springDarts at the moment when the fatal blowHath struck him but unable to proceedPlunges on either side.”,ilias
250. This is connected with the earlier part of last book the regularnarrative being interrupted by the message of Antilochus and thelamentations of Achilles.,ilias
251. —_Far in the deep._ So Oceanus hears the lamentations ofPrometheus in the play of Æschylus and comes from the depths of thesea to comfort him.,ilias
253. Quintus Calaber lib. v. has attempted to rival Homer in hisdescription of the shield of the same hero. A few extracts from Mr.Dyce’s version (Select Translations p. 104 seq.) may here beintroduced.,ilias
“In the wide circle of the shield were seenRefulgent images of various formsThe work of Vulcan; who had there describedThe heaven the ether and the earth and seaThe winds the clouds the moon the sun apartIn different stations; and you there might viewThe stars that gem the still-revolving heavenAnd under them the vast expanse of airIn which with outstretch’d wings the long-beak’d birdWinnow’d the gale as if instinct with life.Around the shield the waves of ocean flow’dThe realms of Tethys which unnumber’d streamsIn azure mazes rolling o’er the earthSeem’d to augment.”,ilias
254. —_On seats of stone._ “Several of the old northern Sagas representthe old men assembled for the purpose of judging as sitting on greatstones in a circle called the Urtheilsring or gerichtsring”— Groteii. p. 100 note. On the independence of the judicial office in Theheroic times see Thirlwall’s Greece vol. i. p. 166.,ilias
“And hereWere horrid wars depicted; grimly paleWere heroes lying with their slaughter’d steedsUpon the ground incarnadin’d with blood.Stern stalked Bellona smear’d with reeking goreThrough charging ranks; beside her Rout was seenAnd Terror Discord to the fatal strifeInciting men and Furies breathing flames:Nor absent were the Fates and the tall shapeOf ghastly Death round whom did Battles throngTheir limbs distilling plenteous blood and sweat;And Gorgons whose long locks were twisting snakes.That shot their forky tongues incessant forth.Such were the horrors of dire war.”,ilias
“Here was a corn field; reapers in a rowEach with a sharp-tooth’d sickle in his handWork’d busily and as the harvest fellOthers were ready still to bind the sheaves:Yoked to a wain that bore the corn awayThe steers were moving; sturdy bullocks hereThe plough were drawing and the furrow’d glebeWas black behind them while with goading wandThe active youths impell’d them. Here a feastWas graved: to the shrill pipe and ringing lyreA band of blooming virgins led the dance.As if endued with life.”—Dyce’s Calaber.,ilias
258. “This legend is one of the most pregnant and characteristic in theGrecian Mythology; it explains according to the religious ideasfamiliar to the old epic poets both the distinguishing attributes andthe endless toil and endurances of Heracles the most renownedsubjugator of all the semi-divine personages worshipped by theHellenes—a being of irresistible force and especially beloved byZeus yet condemned constantly to labour for others and to obey thecommands of a worthless and cowardly persecutor. His recompense isreserved to the close of his career when his afflicting trials arebrought to a close: he is then admitted to the godhead and receives inmarriage Hebe.”—Grote vol. i. p. 128.,ilias
“The blue-eyed maidIn ev’ry breast new vigour to infuse.Brings nectar temper’d with ambrosial dews.”,ilias
260. “Hell is naked before him and destruction hath no covering. Hestretcheth out the north over the empty place and hangeth the earthupon nothing. He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and thecloud is not rent under them.” Job xxvi. 6-8.,ilias
261.“Swift from his throne the infernal monarch ranAll pale and trembling lest the race of manSlain by Jove’s wrath and led by Hermes’ rodShould fill (a countless throng!) his dark abode.”,ilias
262. These words seem to imply the old belief that the Fates might bedelayed but never wholly set aside.,ilias
263. It was anciently believed that it was dangerous if not fatal tobehold a deity. See Exod. xxxiii. 20; Judg. xiii. 22.,ilias
“Outstripp’d the winds in speed upon the plainFlew o’er the field nor hurt the bearded grain:She swept the seas and as she skimm’d alongHer flying feet unbathed on billows hung.”,ilias
266. —_The future father._ “Æneas and Antenor stand distinguished fromthe other Trojans by a dissatisfaction with Priam and a sympathy withthe Greeks which is by Sophocles and others construed as treacherouscollusion—a suspicion indirectly glanced at though emphaticallyrepelled in the Æneas of Virgil.”—Grote i. p. 427.,ilias
“When your Æneas fought but fought with oddsOf force unequal and unequal gods:I spread a cloud before the victor’s sightSustain’d the vanquish’d and secured his flight—Even then secured him when I sought with joyThe vow’d destruction of ungrateful Troy.”,ilias
268. —_On Polydore._ Euripides Virgil and others relate thatPolydore was sent into Thrace to the house of Polymestor forprotection being the youngest of Priam’s sons and that he wastreacherously murdered by his host for the sake of the treasure sentwith him.,ilias
270. Wood has observed that “the circumstance of a falling tree whichis described as reaching from one of its banks to the other affords avery just idea of the breadth of the Scamander.”,ilias
271. —_Ignominious._ Drowning as compared with a death in the field ofbattle was considered utterly disgraceful.,ilias
“So when with crackling flames a caldron friesThe bubbling waters from the bottom rise.Above the brims they force their fiery way;Black vapours climb aloft and cloud the day.”,ilias
273. “This tale of the temporary servitude of particular gods by orderof Jove as a punishment for misbehaviour recurs not unfrequentlyamong the incidents of the Mythical world.”—Grote vol. i. p. 156.,ilias
“On the other sideIncensed with indignation Satan stoodUnterrified and like a comet burn’dThat fires the length of Ophiuchus hugeIn the arctic sky and from his horrid hairShakes pestilence and war.”,ilias
276. The example of Nausicaa in the Odyssey proves that the duties ofthe laundry were not thought derogatory even from the dignity of aprincess in the heroic times.,ilias
278. Such was his fate. After chasing the Trojans into the town he wasslain by an arrow from the quiver of Paris directed under the unerringauspices of Apollo. The greatest efforts were made by the Trojans topossess themselves of the body which was however rescued and borne offto the Grecian camp by the valour of Ajax and Ulysses. Thetis stoleaway the body just as the Greeks were about to burn it with funeralhonours and conveyed it away to a renewed life of immortality in theisle of Leuke in the Euxine.,ilias
279. —_Astyanax_ i.e. the _city-king_ or guardian. It is amusing thatPlato who often finds fault with Homer without reason should havecopied this twaddling etymology into his Cratylus.,ilias
280. This book has been closely imitated by Virgil in his fifth bookbut it is almost useless to attempt a selection of passages forcomparison.,ilias
281. —_Thrice in order led._ This was a frequent rite at funerals. TheRomans had the same custom which they called _decursio._ Plutarchstates that Alexander in after times renewed these same honours tothe memory of Achilles himself.,ilias
282. —_And swore._ Literally and called Orcus the god of oaths towitness. See Buttmann Lexilog p. 436.,ilias
283.“O long expected by thy friends! from whenceArt thou so late return’d for our defence?Do we behold thee wearied as we areWith length of labours and with toils of war?After so many funerals of thy ownArt thou restored to thy declining town?But say what wounds are these? what new disgraceDeforms the manly features of thy face?”,ilias
“In vain I reach my feeble hands to joinIn sweet embraces—ah! no longer thine!She said and from his eyes the fleeting fairRetired like subtle smoke dissolved in air.”,ilias
“So eagerly the fiendO’er bog o’er steep through strait rough dense or rareWith head hands wings or feet pursues his wayAnd swims or sinks or wades or creeps or flies.”,ilias
286.“An ancient forest for the work design’d(The shady covert of the savage kind).The Trojans found: the sounding axe is placed:Firs pines and pitch-trees and the tow’ring prideOf forest ashes feel the fatal strokeAnd piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.High trunks of trees fell’d from the steepy crownOf the bare mountains roll with ruin down.”,ilias
288. The height of the tomb or pile was a great proof of the dignity ofthe deceased and the honour in which he was held.,ilias
291. Virgil by making the boaster vanquished has drawn a better moralfrom this episode than Homer. The following lines deserve comparison:—,ilias
“The haughty Dares in the lists appears:Walking he strides his head erected bears:His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wieldAnd loud applauses echo through the field.* * * *Such Dares was and such he strode alongAnd drew the wonder of the gazing throngHis brawny breast and ample chest he shows;His lifted arms around his head he throwsAnd deals in whistling air his empty blows.His match is sought but through the trembling bandNo one dares answer to the proud demand.Presuming of his force with sparkling eyesAlready he devours the promised prize.* * * *If none my matchless valour dares opposeHow long shall Dares wait his dastard foes?”,ilias
292.“The gauntlet-fight thus ended from the shoreHis faithful friends unhappy Dares bore:His mouth and nostrils pour’d a purple floodAnd pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.”,ilias
293. “Troilus is only once named in the Iliad; he was mentioned also inthe Cypriad but his youth beauty and untimely end made him an objectof great interest with the subsequent poets.”—Grote i p. 399.,ilias
294. Milton has rivalled this passage describing the descent ofGabriel “Paradise Lost” bk. v. 266 seq.,ilias
“Down thither prone in flightHe speeds and through the vast ethereal skySails between worlds and worlds with steady wingNow on the polar winds then with quick fanWinnows the buxom air. * * * ** * * *At once on th’ eastern cliff of ParadiseHe lights and to his proper shape returnsA seraph wing’d. * * * *Like Maia’s son he stoodAnd shook his plumes that heavenly fragrance fill’dThe circuit wide.”,ilias
“Hermes obeys; with golden pinions bindsHis flying feet and mounts the western winds:And whether o’er the seas or earth he fliesWith rapid force they bear him down the skiesBut first he grasps within his awful handThe mark of sovereign power his magic wand;With this he draws the ghost from hollow graves;With this he drives them from the Stygian waves:* * * *Thus arm’d the god begins his airy raceAnd drives the racking clouds along the liquid space.”,ilias
298. The following observations of Coleridge furnish a most gallant andinteresting view of Helen’s character—,ilias
“Few things are more interesting than to observe how the same hand thathas given us the fury and inconsistency of Achilles gives us also theconsummate elegance and tenderness of Helen. She is through the Iliad agenuine lady graceful in motion and speech noble in her associationsfull of remorse for a fault for which higher powers seem responsibleyet grateful and affectionate towards those with whom that fault hadcommitted her. I have always thought the following speech in whichHelen laments Hector and hints at her own invidious and unprotectedsituation in Troy as almost the sweetest passage in the poem. It isanother striking instance of that refinement of feeling and softness oftone which so generally distinguish the last book of the Iliad from therest.”—Classic Poets p. 198 seq.,ilias
299. “And here we part with Achilles at the moment best calculated toexalt and purify our impression of his character. We had accompaniedhim through the effervescence undulations and final subsidence of hisstormy passions. We now leave him in repose and under the fullinfluence of the more amiable affections while our admiration of hisgreat qualities is chastened by the reflection that within a few shortdays the mighty being in whom they were united was himself to besuddenly cut off in the full vigour of their exercise.,ilias
The frequent and touching allusions interspersed throughout the Iliadto the speedy termination of its hero’s course and the moral on thevanity of human life which they indicate are among the finestevidences of the spirit of ethic unity by which the whole framework ofthe poem is united.”—Mure vol. i. p 201.,ilias
300. Cowper says—“I cannot take my leave of this noble poem withoutexpressing how much I am struck with the plain conclusion of it. It islike the exit of a great man out of company whom he has entertainedmagnificently; neither pompous nor familiar; not contemptuous yetwithout much ceremony.” Coleridge p. 227 considers the termination of“Paradise Lost” somewhat similar.,ilias
